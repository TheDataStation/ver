# What is the data discovery problem? How can Ver help?

Data discovery is the problem of identifying and retrieving data that satisfies an information need.

Here, we describe different data discovery scenarios where Ver can help.

## Relational Data Augmentation

You have a table that you use to solve a downstream task, e.g., machine learning or causal inference task. Here, Ver can help you identify attributes
that augment the table in a way that the utility of the downstream task increases.

## Get familiar with a repository and identify data of interest

Some examples are an enterprise data lake, an open data repository, or a collection of databases and other data sources.
