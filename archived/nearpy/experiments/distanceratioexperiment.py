class DistanceRatioExperiment(object):
    """
    Performs nearest neighbour experiments with custom vector data
    for all engines in the specified list.

    Distance ratio is the average distance of retrieved approximated
    neighbours, that are outside the radius of the real nearest N
    neighbours,  with respect to this radius.

    Let R be the radius of the real N nearest neighbours around the
    query vector. Then a distance ratio of 1.0 means, that the average
    approximated nearest neighbour is 2*R away from the query point.
    A distance_ratio of 0.0 means, all approximated neighbours are
    within the radius.

    This is a much better performance measure for ANN than recall or precision,
    because in ANN we are interested in spatial relations between query vector
    and the results.

    perform_experiment() returns list of (distance_ratio, result_size,
    search_time) tuple. These are the averaged values over all request
    vectors. search_time is the average retrieval/search time compared
    to the average exact search time. result_size is the size of the
    retrieved set of approximated neighbours.

    coverage_ratio determines how many of the vectors are used as query
    vectors for exact andapproximated search. Because the search comparance
    overhead is quite large, it is best with large data sets (>10000) to
    use a low coverage_ratio (like 0.1) to make the experiment fast. A
    coverage_ratio of 0.1 makes the experiment use 10% of all the vectors
    for querying, that is, it looks for 10% of all vectors for the nearest
    neighbours.
