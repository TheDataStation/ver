    By: Xing Shi (xingshi@usc.edu)

    This meta-hash performs hash permutations on binary bucket keys.
    You use this just like every other LSHash implementation and
    add the actual binary hashes you want to use via the add_child_hash
    method. Each child hash will be used separatly.

    After all vectors have been indexed you have to call build_permuted_index
    to generate the permuted index.

    So to use this you have to do the following steps:

    1. Create HashPermutations instance and use it in the Engine constructor
    2. Add your binary hashes as child hashes by calling add_child_hash()
    3. Store your vectors using the Engine
    4. Build the permuted index by calling build_permuted_index()
    5. Now when you query the permuted index is used

    If you are adding more vectors afterwards you can update the permuted index
    by calling build_permuted_index() again and again.
