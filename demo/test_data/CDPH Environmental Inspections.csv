I met J. Canchola
(owner) and noted that the pavement at the entrance remained in need of
improvement, the gravel being uneven and water puddles collected -J. Canchola has
gravel onsite to even this and will do so.


There were junks in the center filled with debris around the
container for the gathered scrap -Canchola said that these junks were being
shipped for shred as is and the contents added weight. 

There was again scrap piled up in the dismantle area -Canchola
said that this was scrap sold separately from what was shipped to shred. This material did need to be containerized
for proper storage.

There was evidence of oil on the pavement in the dismantle area -I told Canchola that this area needed
to be cleaned and that was begun immediately.
Canchola said that this was cleaned every day but that needed improved attention.

Today I went for Permit compliance inspection. Findings:


I met J. Canchola
(owner) and noted that the pavement at the entrance and extending into the yard
had been greatly improved by the addition of gravel -J. Canchola said that he had
more gravel onsite to spread when the box of scrap in the next area was shipped
out.

There was scrap piled up near the dismantle area -Canchola
said that this scrap had been sold and he was waiting for it to be picked up by
the customer -this material was being added to but still needed to be
containerized for proper storage.

The ground around the dismantle area
was more like loose dirt -I told Canchola that this area needed to be paved
in the same fashion as the rest of the yard -Canchola said that would begin
immediately.

I noted batteries stored improperly and not as outlined in
the Permit -JC will immediately correct this.

The gravel in the center was uneven
and furrowed -JC says that this area is scheduled to be cleaned up and he will
add gravel

The area where engines are drained had heavily
stained pavement -JC said that they did not have a water connection onsite
for power-washing but would use dry materials for cleaning this.

Parts continue to be separated into scrap and inventory.

Entering the facility, I noted that vehicles remained excessive and crowded the site -this prevented complete inspection due to blockage by vehicles. Batteries were not stored properly, lacking layered materials at the bottom. Batteries were evident in several vehicles ?these were supposed to have already been removed. Junks and parts were stored atop the gravel pile used for filling in pavement potholes. Parts were on the ground in several places.

Today?s I met J. Canchola (owner) for Permit compliance inspection.
Findings: 



There were parts were (transmissions) stored on gravel ?they
had been drained of fluids so the risk of leaked contamination is low.

There were parts on the ground instead of stored properly ?Canchola
said that they had been so busy selling parts that housekeeping had
suffered. Activity had slowed so now
they were focused on gathering parts for scrapping.

Parts had been inventoried and were on the ground
temporarily, waiting for proper storage inside the trailer.

The pavement where outgoing junks are stored prior to
shipment was still uneven gravel. The

gravel. This had not been done but he told me it would be by the end of the
year.

together for free access through the rows ?this had been addressed.

of gravel pavement.

Parts storage was being improved by the removal of racks and
the addition of container boxes.

Today?s inspection is for Permit compliance. Findings: 


They are shifting materials in order to improve the layout and clear out excessive parts (as scrap). There are parts on pallets preparing to be moved to the other side of the yard ?this will be done today. The center portion is largely clear, showing the low spots they need to fill in with gravel ?I will revisit this need in the spring.

Apparently the operator had heeded the directions I had given on the last inspection. Batteries had been improperly stored, lacking layered materials at the bottom -this was not evident today. Batteries had been evident in several vehicles -this was not evident today. Vehicles had remained excessive and crowded the site, preventing complete inspection due to blockage by vehicles.

In the center, excessive vehicles still crowded closely together but access throughout had been improved by scrap being shipped out ?Canchola committed to more outbound shipments and has decided to suspend buying scrap in order to focus on compliance.

During an inspection conducted on July 20, 2020 (see Inspection 1521061), Inspector Ricker was accompanied by Environmental Engineer Stephanie Sampra. Based on Engineer Sampra's observations, it was noted that the site employed a vehicle crushing machine which had not been included on their permit. The site was subsequently given 30 days to apply to add the machinery to the permit, which they did immediately. This inspection was in response to that application. At the time of the inspection, the vehicle crusher was observed to be stored on a concrete pad. Based on information obtained from site personnel, as well as observations made during the site inspection, this is a mobile unit. Apparently this mobility is used to be able to transfer the equipment to other facilities for crushing operations. According to site personnel, the crusher is not used or stored anywhere besides the concrete pad. The concrete pad, which was observed to be in good condition, with no cracks or breaks observed, was installed specifically for the machine per site personnel.Four sewer inlets were observed in the central portion of the site. One of these inlets was a trench drain which, according to site personnel, was attached to one of the other drains which apparently lead to the municipal sewer system. No filters or mesh were observed covering these inlets. Site personnel indicated they had them and would to install them. These inlets were not observed to be in the direct vicinity of where work is conducted, and they appeared clean during the inspection (no vehicle fluids were observed in or around the inlets).

Today?s I met J.
Canchola (or JC, owner) for Permit compliance inspection. Findings: 



I noted that the pavement throughout was in need of improvement with the gravel
at the entrance and in the center being uneven and furrowed. Standing water was a problem -JC said that he
planned to have cement poured when the weather permits.

I noted that the pavement at the entrance remained in need
of improvement, with the gravel at the entrance and in the center being uneven
and some water pooling -J. Canchola (owner) had said that he planned to have
cement poured when the weather permits. 

There was scrap piled up in the dismantle area -Canchola
said that this was scrap that he sold separately from what was shipped to shred. This material did need to be containerized
for proper storage.

Today?s inspection is for Permit compliance. Findings: 


Entering the facility, I noted that vehicles remained excessive and crowded the site -this usually prevented complete inspection due to blockage by vehicles. Beyond some of the vehicles is an area where some vehicles had been shipped out and showed a small amount of improvement in that area.

The pavement (some cement, some asphalt, some gravel) needed improvement as evident by the presence of mud.

At the entrance, the gravel had been improved as suggested
but there were still areas that needed leveling -Rojas said that they had just
gotten a delivery of gravel for those areas.

Parts had leaked oil onto the gravel -Rojas will have the
contaminated gravel removed and fresh gravel spread.

Parts were piled up instead of stored on racks or shelves ?Rojas
will address this.

Findings and Site walkthrough

During the site inspection I observed the site pavement improved. No excessive water ponding was observed at this time. Asphalt grindings was used to level the pavement as needed. This facility frequentlyloads and unloads scrap from river barges to and from theriver bank. The area is sloped away from the river and no run-off was seen going into the river. 


Yard #1 area is used for loading and unloading scrap from barges on the river. An oil and water separator collects oily residues from certain scrap and is stored of a concrete surface. Current scrap inventory included, but was not limited to PS, HMS, bushling, and mill scale and all piles were labeled. Processing in this yard is limited to sheering and torching. Observed pavement improvements in this area. 


In the area known as yard #2truck trailers and buses are dismantled and stored.Observed previous material processed and removed.The non-ferrous yard, baling and sorting of commercial scrap was observed in yard #6.<SPAN style='mso-spacerun: ye",DEPT.

The owner was not present for inspection so I went with Stacy (employee). Findings:


Due to a large influx of junks, the site is crowded. This has caused all areas to be filled and housekeeping to suffer. 

Engines are piled on the ground ?I told Stacy that this must be addressed.

Radiators are stored on top of a storage box ?Stacy said that these are kept here until they are picked up for scrapping.

Upon arrival, I spoke and toured the facility with Jorge Navarro, Art Caldwell, Ricky, Debbie Hays and George Malamis. We also reviewed the permit. The Paulina facility consists of 4 yards: Yard #1, 2, 6, and 10.


Yard #1:

SIMS loads and unloads scrap from barges on the river. An oil and water separator collects oily residues from certain scrap and is stored of a concrete surface. The area is sloped away from the river and no run-off was seen going into the river. Current scrap inventory included, but was not limited to PS, HMS, bushling, and mill scale and all piles were labeled. 


Yard #2:

SIMS mostly dismantles/demolishes truck trailers and serves as a out flow for sheet metal before it?s put through the shredder.

Upon arrival I met Messrs. James M. Langbehn (Terminal Manager) and Steve Kroon (Environmental and Safety Compliance Manager). Process flow of all the material handled by the facility is as follows: Materials are received by Barge, Trucks and Rail, they are then taken into the storage. From the storage the materials can pass through either packaging, crushing or screening processes. Followed by shipping. According to James, some materials can be shipped directly from storage buildings without passing through any packaging, crushing or screening processes. Materials are moved around the facility with the help of bucket loaders (front-end loaders) and dump trucks. Bucket loaders can take about 20,000 pound of the material per trip and they are not covered. Dump trucks can take about 40,000 pound of the material per trip and they are not covered also. The materials are stored both outside and inside of the facility. There are two main buildings for material storage, these are Ryerson and Norcon.

Today, I met KK for inspection. Findings:

Tires lacking rims had been stored outside -these had mostly been removed, except for the spare ones for their machine. Today a few more tires lacking rims were noted ?KK will address this immediately.

Parts (engines) are still stored piled up over gavel and loose dirt ?KK says the vendor to buy these is coming today and after they?ve been hauled this area will be cleaned up.

The pavement is still in disrepair ?KK says expecting to get a loan for the $16-20,000 it will cost to replace/add the cement pavement and hopes to be able to begin in August.

findings:

Junks
were still stored on top of the asphalt they used onsite ?KK had improved that
slightly but needed to do more. 

There
were a few containers of gas lacking secondary containment ?KK said that this
was ?good gas? which was going to be used onsite. I told KK that secondary containment was
required for ALL fluids ?he will ensure proper storage.

There
were several engines on the ground ?KK said that these had been sold and were

He said the material mustnot be wet or sprayed with water because of the customers (customers preferred the material dry). The control device (mobile water sprinkler system) was present during the unloading operation, but too far to effectively control the dust emissions from the operation.

According to James, some materials can be shipped directly from storage buildings without passing through any packaging, crushing or screening processes. Materials are moved around the facility with the help of bucket loaders (front-end loaders) and dump trucks.

Findings and Site walkthrough

During the site inspection I observed the site pavement improved. No excessive water ponding was observed at this time. Asphalt grindings was used to level the pavement as needed. This facility frequentlyloads and unloads scrap from river barges to and from theriver bank.The area is sloped away from the river and no run-off was seen going into the river.


Yard #2truck trailers and buses are dismantled and stored.Material observed in this was stored in large pile and contained. The non-ferrous yard, baling and sorting of commercial scrap was observed in yard #6.

for pavement -KK was supposed to have this cleared out and levelled.

A steel plate had been placed where junks are flattened. This will protect the cement ground from
being damage and make cleanup easier.

PROCESS DESCRIPTION

This is a warehouse for steel and foundry materials. Steel and Foundry materials are received in rail cars, trucks and barge. They are re-packaged into bags of various sizes and other containers and then sent to customers in trucks. 

NARRATIVE

I carried out the inspection of S H Bell Company for the issuance of annual certificate of operation (a periodic milestone inspection). Upon arrival I met James Langbehn who took me around the facility for today inspection. I observed particulate dust emissions inside the facility most especially at the bagging of Electrolytic Manganese (see photo log). Electrolytic Manganese is a material susceptible to becoming windborne. The efficiency of the baghouse (the dust collection system) for this bagging and loading operations is questionable. More efforts and precautions should betaken in controlling particulate dust emissions in the facility. 

S H Bell Company was served with notice of violation# E000024788 13 for the municipal codes violations 11-4-760 (Handling of Material Susceptible to Becoming Windborne) and 7-28-080 (Nuisance in Connection with a Business).

Today I inspected with KK -findings:

The site is not as full of junks as usual. The pavement in the central/northern area had
a lot of loose dirt on the surface -KK said that must clear this area of junks
before levelling it. I told him that the
dirt was unacceptable as pavement and he said that he would look into having
concrete put down.

The scrap area was flooded with
water -KK said that there was no sewer drain in this area. They typically scoop the water into outgoing
loads while loading. I told him that he
should consider using a pump to transfer water to the nearest drain to address
this when it became excessive, like it is today.

Process flow of all the material handled by the facility is as follows: Materials are received by Barge, Trucks and Rail, they are then taken into the storage. From the storage the materials can pass through either packaging, crushing or screening processes. Followed by shipping. According to James, some materials can be shipped directly from storage buildings without passing through any packaging, crushing or screening processes. Materials are moved around the facility with the help of bucket loaders (front-end loaders) and dump trucks. Bucket loaders can take about 20,000 pound of the material per trip and they are not covered. Dump trucks can take about 40,000 pound of the material per trip and they are not covered also. The materials are stored inside of the facility, except pig iron whichis stored outside of the facility. There are two main buildings for material storage, these are Ryerson and Norcon. Particle size distribution analysis has never beencompleted for all the material handled by SH Bell including manganese. The retention time for any of the materials depends on the owner (SH Bell as a storage facility, stores materials for owners), some materials could be stored for a year or more until the owner requested for it. Hence, any pile of material can be a longer-term. Average pile size is 14 fee",DEPT.

Today I inspected, accompanied by KK. Findings:

Due to another large influx of junks, the site is crowded. This again has caused all areas to be filled and housekeeping to suffer. The ground where some parts are stored has piles of dirt and trash intermingled ?I told KK to address the pavement and cleanliness issue.

findings:

Junks
were no longer stored on top of the asphalt they used onsite but the site is
almost full of junks, some with flattened roofs but many others not yet
flattened for shipment.

There
were again containers of gas lacking secondary containment -I had told KK previously
that secondary containment was required for ALL fluids and he was supposed to
ensure proper storage.

There
were puddles of water throughout. Site
pavements were not allowing proper stormwater runoff.

findings:

Part
of the junks storage area was a mixture of dirt and gravel ?I told KK that the
dirt was not acceptable and he should pave the area completely with gravel,
asphalt, or cement, etc.

Junks
were stored on top of the gravel they used onsite ?I told KK that junks should
be stored on the ground or stacked on other junks. 

There
has been a large improvement by the addition of new cement to the
heavily-damaged pavement in the processing area.

Today is mostly cloudy, temperature: high 82 degreeF, low 65 degree F, wind SW at 14 mph and gust 23. SH Bell Company provides handling, storage, processing, and packaging services of two types of manganese which are: High Carbon Ferrous Manganese and Silicon Manganese, also pig iron, ferrous silicon (FeSi), Aluminum, Zinc, Refractory,and other alloy agent to a customer base; comprised of producers, and international traders and importers of metals, minerals, and semi-finished raw materials used in industrial processes in North America.Upon arrivalwe metPaul Chepela (Plant Manager). Based on my previous inspection of the facility and my conversation with facility plant manager, I understand the process flow of all the material handled by the facility is as follows: Materials are received by Barge, Trucks and Rail, they are then taken into the storage. From the storage the materials can pass through either packaging, crushing or screening processes. Followed by shipping. Some materials can be shipped directly from storage buildings without passing through any packaging, crushing or screening processes. Materials are moved around the facility with the help of bucket loaders (front-end loaders) and dump trucks. Bucket loaders can take about 20,000 pound of the material per trip and they are not covered. I did not observe bucket loaders (front end loaders) in use as at the time of this inspection. Dump trucks can take about 40,000 pound of the material per trip and they are not covered also. I observed dump trucks moving material around today, I did not observe particulate matter emissions from the dump trucks. The materials are stored inside of the facility, except for pig iron whichis stored outside of the facility. There are two main buildings for material storage, these ",DEPT.

The site is not as full of junks, although there are still
many. The ground along the northern portion
was littered with plastic and the assorted debris from the crushed junks. The pavement is also loose dirt. . KK is waiting until he ships out the junks on
this side to clean and address the pavement.

The area where junks are flattened is also similarly
littered with debris -I told KK that this area needed cleaning also.

There was still broken pavement and standing water -I had
previously told KK that this must be repaired for proper site drainage.

According to James, some materials can be shipped directly from storage buildings without passing through any packaging, crushing or screening processes. Materials are moved around the facility with the help of bucket loaders (front-end loaders) and dump trucks. Bucket loaders can take about 20,000 pound of the material per trip and they are not covered. Dump trucks can take about 40,000 pound of the material per trip and they are not covered also.

was junking these with the plan to use the asphalt to fill in potholes but this
had not been done. KK was experiencing
difficulties with his auto shredder due to them moving to a different

The
property dipped down in one area due to previous structures which had been
demolished years ago. Scrap ended up
collecting on this portion, causing a mess- I told KK that he must prevent
scrap from collecting here. Levelling

Messrs Kevin Smith and Evan Traverso (from City of Chicago Inspector General Office) were with me for this inspection. Today is partly cloudy, temperature: high72 degree F, low61 degree F, wind ESE at10 mph. SH Bell Company provides handling, storage, processing, and packaging services of two types of manganese which are: High Carbon Ferrous Manganese and Silicon Manganese, also pig iron, ferrous silicon (FeSi), Aluminum, Zinc, Refractory,and other alloy agent to a customer base; comprised of producers, and international traders and importers of metals, minerals, and semi-finished raw materials used in industrial processes in North America.

Upon arrival I met James M. Langbehn the facility plant manager who took me around the facility for today inspection. Process flow of all the material handled by the facility is as follows: Materials are received by Barge, Trucks and Rail, they are then taken into the storage. From the storage the materials can pass through either packaging, crushing or screening processes. Followed by shipping. According to James, some materials can be shipped directly from storage buildings without passing through any packaging, crushing or screening processes. Materials are moved around the facility with the help of bucket loaders (front-end loaders) and dump trucks. Bucket loaders can take about 20,000 pound of the material per trip and they are not covered. Dump trucks can take about 40,000 pound of the material per trip and they are not covered also. The materials are stored inside of the facility, except pig iron whichis stored outside of the facility. There are two main buildings for material storage, these are Ryerson and Norcon.

Where junks were stored there was scrap mixed with junks ?KK
will improve storage in this area.

There was dirt piled on top of the pavement (cement) ?KK will
have this area cleaned.

The totes containing gasoline still lacked secondary
containment ?KK was supposed to have this addressed by now. He will be cited if not remedied by next

Tires lacking rims had been stored outside -these had mostly been removed, except for the spare ones for their machine.

Junk vehicles and scrap still being stored atop gravel used for pavement -KK says they are loading the gravel out, beginning next week. This will open up the area for operating space.

Parts are still stored over gravel and loose dirt ?this will be cleaned up and made neater thus more suitable.

The pavement is still in disrepair ?KK is applying for a loan for the $16-20,000cost to replace/repair the cement. He hopes to be able to begin in August.

Sims metal management facility


A routine inspection of SIMS main processing and storage yard was conducted.

Yard #1:

SIMS loads and unloads scrap from barges on the river. An oil and water separator collects oily residues from certain scrap and is stored of a concrete surface. The area is sloped away from the river and no run-off was seen going into the river. Current scrap inventory included, but was not limited to PS, HMS, bushling, and mill scale and all piles were labeled. 


Yard #2:

SIMS mostly dismantles/demolishes truck trailers and serves as a out flow for sheet metal before it?s put through the shredder.

Findings and Site walkthrough

During the site inspection I observed the site pavement improved. No excessive water ponding was observed at this time. Asphalt grindings was used to level the pavement as needed. This facility frequentlyloads and unloads scrap from river barges to and from theriver bank. The area is sloped away from the river and no run-off was seen going into the river. 


Yard #1 area is used for loading and unloading scrap from barges on the river. An oil and water separator collects oily residues from certain scrap and is stored of a concrete surface. Current scrap inventory included, but was not limited to PS, HMS, bushling, and mill scale and all piles were labeled. Processing in this yard is limited to sheering and torching. Observed pavement improvements in this area. 


In the area known as yard #2truck trailers and buses are dismantled and stored.Material observed in this was stored in large pile and contained.

Today, I met KK for inspection. Findings:

There is a pile of wood and wooden furniture ?KK says this had come inside of a junk and had to been collected for disposal as waste.

Parts (engines) are still piled up ?KK says that they shipped several out last week and expect to ship more this week.

The pavement is still in disrepair ?KK was expecting to get a loan for the $16-20,000 it will cost to replace/add the cement pavement but has had more financial barriers that temporarily stops that from happening.

The inspection was conducted to assess and evaluate remaining hazardous and special wastes remaining within the former hospital. Asbestos and lead removals and refrigerant recoveries were completed and documented prior to the inspection. Some remaining refrigerants and copper wire were still being removed at the time of the inspection. Berger stated that Heneghan's contractor HEPA Environmental, had removed all remaining asbestos within the building and their report is available with Heneghan's other filed documents within their application packet to demolish the building. Berger stated that currently the remaining refrigerants within the building were being recovered and that operation would be completed within a few days. Copper wire from the building was also being recovered and that activity was also being completed. All of the floor tiles from within the building had been removed and that activity was inspected during the removal (See report by Inspector Flores Silva for more details). Berger was asked if the building had X-Ray machines or an MRI machine. Berger stated that it was unlikely to have had an MRI machine due to the thickness of concrete required for the machine, as their pre-demolition inspections did not reveal that thickness of concrete within the building. Based upon the observations, statements made and documents filed, this pre-demolition inspection is closed.  ",DEPT.
