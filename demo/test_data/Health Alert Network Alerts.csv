Last week, CDC’s Division of STD Prevention released a Dear Colleagues letter (see attached) regarding two gonococcal infections of concerning antimicrobial susceptibility profile and/or genotype identified in Massachusetts (<a href=""https://t.emailupdates.cdc.gov/r/?id=h753800f4,182b6f7a,183751b1&amp;e=QUNTVHJhY2tpbmdJRD1VU0NEQ05QSU5fMTIyLURNOTcxNzAmQUNTVHJhY2tpbmdMYWJlbD1BTVIlMjBHb25vcnJoZWElM0ElMjBUd28lMjBDYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwQ29uY2VybiUyMElkZW50aWZpZWQ&amp;s=Bn1g9FtnqJDbxgFSvx9luOAraI6zhdZuzX2DsCv2NyQ"" target=""_blank"">clinical alert</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The AR Lab Network public health labs continue to be critical partners in detection of and response to antimicrobial resistance. &nbsp;In 2021, CDC supported expansion of AR Lab Network, using American Rescue Plan Act funding, to build capacity for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates using a gradient strip method. This expanded capacity provides access to gonococcal AST, especially for cases of concern. &nbsp;If your jurisdiction receives inquiries about testing and is not currently providing this testing, AR Lab Network regional labs in <a href=""https://doh.wa.gov/public-health-healthcare-providers/public-health-laboratories/arln-lab-test-menu"" target=""_blank"">Washington</a> and <a href=""https://health.maryland.gov/laboratories/Pages/ARLNHome.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Maryland</a> provide this testing nationwide. &nbsp;Please refer to attached fact sheet for additional information and to share with your clinical partners.</p>

<p><strong>Action Items</strong><br />
If patients persistently test positive for N. gonorrhoeae (gonococcus or GC) after treatment (with or without symptoms) and reinfection has been ruled out, please consider sending their specimen or isolate for susceptibility testing. Data from this testing helps CDC monitor for new types of resistance and can provide information for treatment decisions.</p>

<p><strong>What are the actions to participate in N. gonorrhoeae gradient strip AST service?</strong><br />
Do one of the following:</p>

<ul>

","**Summary**   

Last week, CDC's Division of STD Prevention released a Dear Colleagues letter (see attached) regarding two gonococcal infections of concerning antimicrobial susceptibility profile and/or genotype identified in Massachusetts ([clinical alert](https://t.emailupdates.cdc.gov/r/?id=h753800f4,182b6f7a,183751b1&e=QUNTVHJhY2tpbmdJRD1VU0NEQ05QSU5fMTIyLURNOTcxNzAmQUNTVHJhY2tpbmdMYWJlbD1BTVIlMjBHb25vcnJoZWElM0ElMjBUd28lMjBDYXNlcyUyMG9mJTIwQ29uY2VybiUyMElkZW50aWZpZWQ&s=Bn1g9FtnqJDbxgFSvx9luOAraI6zhdZuzX2DsCv2NyQ)).

The AR Lab Network public health labs continue to be critical partners in detection of and response to antimicrobial resistance. In 2021, CDC supported expansion of AR Lab Network, using American Rescue Plan Act funding, to build capacity for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates using a gradient strip method. This expanded capacity provides access to gonococcal AST, especially for cases of concern. If your jurisdiction receives inquiries about testing and is not currently providing this testing, AR Lab Network regional labs in [Washington](https://doh.wa.gov/public-health-healthcare-providers/public-health-laboratories/arln-lab-test-menu) and [Maryland](https://health.maryland.gov/laboratories/Pages/ARLNHome.aspx) provide this testing nationwide. Please refer to attached fact sheet for additional information and to share with your clinical partners.

**Action Items**   

If patients persistently test positive for N. gonorrhoeae (gonococcus or GC) after treatment (with or without symptoms) and reinfection has been ruled out, please consider sending their specimen or isolate for susceptibility testing. Data from this testing helps CDC monitor for new types of resistance and can provide information for treatment decisions.

**What are the actions to participate in N. gonorrhoeae gradient strip AST service?**   

Do one of the following:

* **Submit a fresh clinical specimen** to your local laboratory that performs GC culture and **ask them to save an isolate** for shipment to Maryland Public Health Laboratory (MDPHL) or Washington State Public Health Lab (WSPHL).
* **Ask the laboratory** that has already isolated GC from your patient **to ship the isolate to MDPHL or WSPHL** for further testing.
* If a local laboratory is **not available** to perform GC culture, **please email** [MDPHL.arln@maryland.gov](mailto:MDPHL.arln@maryland.gov) or [ARLN@doh.wa.gov](mailto:ARLN@doh.wa.gov) to plan specimen collection and shipment for GC culture.

IDPH: Cessation of Monitoring of Travelers from Uganda for Ebola,2023-01-12T15:52:00.000,46676978,Ebola,Ebola,High,IDPH: Cessation of Monitoring of Travelers from Uganda for Ebola,"<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>The Ugandan outbreak of Ebola disease caused by Sudan virus was identified on October 6, 2022. Funneling of travelers through five U.S. airports began on October 10 and traveler information was shared with state and local health departments for monitoring purposes on October 11. Over 4,200 travelers were monitored nationwide.</p>

<p>The Ugandan outbreak of Sudan virus has been declared over by Uganda and the World Health Organization on 1/11/2023, when 42 days have passed since the last Ebola case in Uganda was considered to be potentially infectious. As a result of this outbreak, there were 164 cases with 77 deaths due to Sudan virus in Uganda, including 19 healthcare worker cases. CDC provided 38 clinical consultations regarding travelers who developed some symptoms after their arrival in the U.S. Testing was recommended for four individuals and all four tested negative for Ebola Sudan virus. No Sudan virus cases were reported in countries outside of Uganda.</p>

<p><strong>Monitoring of travelers</strong></p>

<p>With the passing of the 42 days since a case, monitoring by public health authorities of travelers from Uganda will end in the U.S. Monitoring may cease for any individuals who are currently being monitored and there is no further need to contact any travelers that were referred for monitoring on, or after January 10th.</p>

<p><strong>Health care providers</strong></p>

<p>Routine use of infection control and clinical care measures specifically directed at the possible diagnosis of Ebola disease need no longer be universally implemented when evaluating travelers from Uganda. Survivor programs in Uganda are working with Sudan virus survivors and informing males that they can have virus in their semen for up to 36 months following infection. Transmission from persistent virus in semen is known to occur, but the risk is not well established.</p>

<p>As always, it is critical for health care providers to obtain a travel and contact history for individuals presenting with fever and/or other infectious disease symptoms, and use appropriate infection control measures, including standard precautions for all patients and isolation precautions (contact, droplet, and/or airborne) based on the clinical syndrome and/or diagnosis.</p>

VFC Blended Inventory Guidance,2023-01-06T21:27:39.000,46676678,VFC,Vaccines for Children,High,VFC Blended Inventory Guidance,"<p>The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) are pleased to announce that, beginning Saturday, January 14, 2023, VFC and CHIP providers will be able to combine their CHIP and VFC vaccines into one inventory in their storage units. For several years, CDC has required IDPH and CDPH to enforce the use of separate inventories for VFC and CHIP vaccines. Due to recent changes, including the expansion of Medicaid in Illinois, IDPH and CDPH have worked successfully with CDC to modify this requirement. At that time, all VFC providers can offer vaccines from their blended inventories to both VFC and CHIP-eligible children.</p>

<p>We expect this to be a huge win for providers and children throughout the state. It reduces administrative burden and space required in storage units, and it will ensure that CHIP-eligible children throughout the state can be served by all providers that offer VFC vaccines.</p>

<p>The VFC and CHIP vaccines that are currently in the field will be merged into one blended inventory, and all orders going forward will be deemed to be part of the blended inventory. You will see changes to your inventories in I-CARE on Friday, January 13, 2023. If you have discrepancies in your inventories, please work to resolve these prior to IDPH making the inventory adjustments.</p>

<p>Per the attached guidance, children must still be checked in Medi, and their VFC or CHIP eligibility should be marked correctly in the patient record in I-CARE, including vaccine data entered directly into I-CARE and data that is transmitted from an EHR. Vaccine data with VFC reasons including V02 for Title 19-elgible children and V22 for Title 21-eligible children will be deducted from the new blended<br />
inventory.</p>

<p>This change follows the Medicaid Expansion announced by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS) in September. See <a href=""https://www2.illinois.gov/hfs/MedicalProviders/notices/Pages/prn220909c.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Provider Notice Issued 09/09/2022 | HFS (illinois.gov)</a> and <a href=""https://www2.illinois.gov/hfs/MedicalProviders/notices/Pages/prn220922a.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Provider Notice Issued 09/22/2022 | HFS (illinois.gov)</a> for more information. About 190,000 children throughout the state are now eligible for VFC vaccine through the Medicaid Expansion program.</p>

<p>Two training dates are scheduled. See attached flyer for registration information or use this <a href=""https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_wfmxoHb6Qj682WZ_AnJexQ"" target=""_blank"">LINK</a> to register. Trainings are scheduled as follows:<br />

","The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) is announcing The Rapid Response Evaluation And Treatment of COVID-19 (**TREAT COVID-19**) program, funded by CDC. CDPH is working in partnership with the Chicago Internal Medicine Practice and Research (CIMPAR). CIMPAR S.C was started by Dr. Dheeraj Mahajan as a way of breaking down healthcare silos. They thrive on their ability to provide difficult and custom health and wellness solutions to people, employers, healthcare organizations and public health departments.

**TREAT COVID-19** provides wrap around services for COVID-19 treatment and outbreak mitigation efforts to long-term care facility residents. **The service includes capacity for medical consultation and drug interaction review, medication delivery logistics, and the prompt administration of medication with appropriate observation time** . Other services include point-of-care diagnostic testing and vaccination, which will contribute to the early mitigation of outbreaks and prevent healthcare system burden from hospitalizations. **These services come at no cost to facilities or their residents**.

Wednesday 11/30/2022, the [National Institute of Health (NIH) treatment guidelines for non-hospitalized patients who are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 identified the preferred therapies for COVID-19](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/tables/therapeutic-management-of-nonhospitalized-adults/) as ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and remdesivir (Veklury). Both medications are highly effective in reducing the severity of COVID-19 illness in high-risk patients. However, both have unique administration considerations (such as drug interactions for Paxlovid and intravenous administration for Veklury) that have kept long term care providers from using them. **This new program supports long term care facilities and clinicians by providing residents with rapid access to the preferred treatment options for COVID-19**.

If your facility is experiencing multiple COVID-19 infections among residents, please contact [Chicago-covid19@cimpar.com](mailto:Chicago-covid19@cimpar.com) or (708) 600-4233 for a consultation with the TREAT COVID-19 program.

**Pfizer is seeking shelf-life extensions for all vaccines formulations that are on the market from the FDA** - please be on the lookout for that notice. For Pfizer vaccines both bivalent and monovalent for ages 12 and older, the order minimum has been decreased to 180 doses for direct shipment.

**Please be sure to continue to properly store and quarantine COVID-19 vaccines 2 months past expiry in the event that more shelf - life extensions are granted**. As always, vaccine administration with those doses cannot occur until an official shelf - life extension has been granted. Doses need to be properly stored for them to be viable after extension has been granted.

You can expect ""short-dated"" vaccine shipped to you, but since shelf-life extensions have been granted for the above Moderna lot numbers and we are expecting shelf-life extensions for Pfizer as well we know that these doses will be viable past the listed expiration date.

Vaccine requests can continue to be placed via our routine survey: <https://redcap.dph.illinois.gov/surveys/?s=8Y8D38XKNA>. Please note that shipping will be constricted around the observed holidays, but doses will still be shipping outside of those dates. If you have direct concerns, please reach out to us at [COVID19vaccine@cityofchicago.org](mailto:COVID19vaccine@cityofchicago.org).

Influenza-like illness activity continues to increase in the United States and has reached high activity levels in Illinois. Many counties have experienced increasing levels of influenza-like illness (characterized as fever of 100ºF [37.8ºC] or higher plus cough and/or sore throat), increases in influenza-related ICU admissions, long-term care facility influenza outbreaks, and increases in influenza positive laboratory specimens.</p>

</ul>

<p>Exemptions to these temporary visitor restrictions are permissible at the discretion of the facility’s Infection Prevention and Control departments for circumstances including, but not limited to, end-of-life situations.

Local health departments and facilities should monitor influenza-like illness activity in their community and facilities should monitor the level of activity and severity of illness they are experiencing within their facility (ER and urgent care visits, influenza hospitalizations, etc.) to help guide them with these decisions. The weekly Illinois influenza surveillance report is also a useful tool when evaluating activity levels for this purpose.<br />

IDPH:  Bed Reporting in EMResource,2022-11-10T21:57:14.000,46675679,Hospital Notification,"Diseases & Conditions,COVID,Announcement",High,IDPH:  Bed Reporting in EMResource,"<p>Many parts of the country are experiencing a surge in pediatric respiratory illnesses. Factors such as continued spread of COVID-19, the arrival of flu season, and an increase in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases are impacting the healthcare system and hospital bed availability.</p>

<p>IDPH continues to monitor bed reporting and bed availability trends. As the cases of RSV continue to rise, the Department has decided to increase the bed availability reporting frequency for pediatric and pediatric intensive care beds. Additionally, there is a need to understand the number of children who may be holding in emergency departments awaiting bed placement or transfer to an appropriate children’s hospital.</p>

<p>On or before November 14, 2022, hospitals will do the following:</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px"">1. Update bed availability for the following categories <strong><em>every 8 hours</em></strong> (10am, 6pm, and 2am)</p>

<p style=""margin-left:80px"">a. Pediatric Intensive Care (PICU)<br />
b. Pediatrics (Peds)<br />
c. ED Boarders</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px""><em><u>Rationale</u>: This will provide enhanced awareness of the available pediatric beds statewide and allow hospitals visibility when attempting to find open beds for transfer to the most appropriate facility with beds available. This will hopefully cut down on the number of phone calls a hospital attempts to make for patient transfer.</em></p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px"">2. Specify the number of ED Boarders for ages 0-2 years</p>

","Many parts of the country are experiencing a surge in pediatric respiratory illnesses. Factors such as continued spread of COVID-19, the arrival of flu season, and an increase in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases are impacting the healthcare system and hospital bed availability.

IDPH continues to monitor bed reporting and bed availability trends. As the cases of RSV continue to rise, the Department has decided to increase the bed availability reporting frequency for pediatric and pediatric intensive care beds. Additionally, there is a need to understand the number of children who may be holding in emergency departments awaiting bed placement or transfer to an appropriate children's hospital.

On or before November 14, 2022, hospitals will do the following:

1. Update bed availability for the following categories ***every 8 hours*** (10am, 6pm, and 2am)

a. Pediatric Intensive Care (PICU)  

b. Pediatrics (Peds)  

c. ED Boarders

*++Rationale++: This will provide enhanced awareness of the available pediatric beds statewide and allow hospitals visibility when attempting to find open beds for transfer to the most appropriate facility with beds available. This will hopefully cut down on the number of phone calls a hospital attempts to make for patient transfer.*

2. Specify the number of ED Boarders for ages 0-2 years

a. Provide the total number of ED Boarders in the appropriate section  

b. Using the comments section, provide the number of ED Boarders that are ages 0-4 years

*++Rationale:++This will provide enhanced awareness of the younger patient population that are requiring bed placement and may require specialized age specific equipment and patient care resources.*

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is issuing this Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory to emphasize the importance of following existing recommendations for maintaining and monitoring dental waterlines. Multiple outbreaks of nontuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) infections have occurred in children who received pulpotomies in pediatric dental clinics where the dental treatment water contained high levels of bacteria.

* Healthcare facilities are already experiencing staffing shortages that will be further exacerbated if additional staff are excluded due to illness
* It will be difficult to implement frequent changes to facility-specific masking policies as the county transmission level and facility outbreak status will inevitably fluctuate

Employers and facilities may choose to implement additional strategies in order to protect staff, patients, and residents from COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses.

Illinois has seen a steady increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations due to respiratory infections (especially RSV) in those under 18. The elevated visits and hospitalizations are creating a health system crisis in pediatric critical care access with an acute shortage in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) beds, directly impacting the health system capacity heading into the fall/winter. This advisory is to alert providers to the situation and provide tools to help mitigate the surge in respiratory illnesses.</p>

<p><strong>Situational Awareness</strong><br />
Currently in Illinois, there are 289 PICU beds; with more than 50% of the beds in the City of Chicago. As of October 18, 2022, there were only 6% open PICU beds remaining across the state. As we head into flu season and await a potential COVID-19 surge, this low number of PICU beds makes prevention of non-vaccine preventable infections, like RSV and other respiratory diseases, even more important. When<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7046a5.htm"" target=""_blank""> PICU bed capacity is compromised, the hospital system’s ability to fully address acute care and serious illness may also become compromised, leading to severe health outcomes, including death</a>. Protecting this critical infrastructure is vital for children across Illinois.</p>

<p><strong>Health Care Facility Surge Mitigation Strategies</strong><br />
Providers and health care facilities are advised to consider the following mitigation measures to ease the strain on PICU bed capacity:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Enhance communications with other hospitals that have pediatric units.</li>
	<li>Expedite discharges when applicable, including considering the feasibility of home health care and home hospital care.</li>
	<li>Utilize contractual staffing.</li>
	<li>Cross-train other non-pediatric staff who may be able to provide patient care in pediatric areas.</li>
	<li>Ensure timely and accurate reporting of available staffed pediatric and PICU beds.</li>
	<li>Increase the frequency of pediatric bed availability reporting in EmResource for a region or regions.</li>
	<li>Share information/education on wearing face masks, enhancing hand hygiene and physical distancing, particularly for those children with chronic medical conditions/weakened immune conditions.</li>

","On September 2, 2022 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued revised recommendations related to COVID-19 vaccinations and revised the definition of ""up-to-date"" to include the primary vaccination series, applicable monovalent boosters, and the updated bivalent booster. [Stay Up to Date with COVID-19 Vaccines Including Boosters](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html)

The Illinois Department of Public Health (Department) is in the process of updating guidance that aligns with the CDC recommendations and anticipates the Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid Services (CMS) will soon issue updated guidance surrounding quarantine and COVID-19 testing requirements in certified facilities. The Department's administrative regulations applicable to certified skilled nursing facilities, intermediate care for the developmentally disabled facilities, and medically complex for the developmentally disabled facilities require staff that are not ""up-to-date"" to be tested for COVID-19 based on the level of community transmission (low, moderate, and substantial or high). Currently, just two counties, Brown and Marshall, are at a moderate level of transmission. All other counties in Illinois are at a substantial or high level of transmission.

Given the CDC's recommendations, current CMS requirements, state regulations for licensed facilities, and the availability of the bivalent COVID-19 vaccination, the Department encourages long-term care providers to:

* Begin planning for booster clinics and administration of the bivalent (updated) vaccine
* Contact the usual vaccine provider to arrange a date for the COVID-19 bivalent booster vaccinations to be administered
* Educate staff, residents, families, and caregivers on the CDC recommendations and benefit of receiving the bivalent vaccine
* Implement a risk-based approach when quarantining new residents and residents that leave the facility for more than 24 hours taking into consideration whether the resident is up-to-date with monovalent boosters
* Ensure the facility continues to implement best infection control measure that prevent the spread of COVID-19 such as screening, the use of masks, and personal protective equipment

The Department will consider these factors together with the availability of the bivalent vaccine, the time necessary to plan for additional booster clinics, and the opportunity to ensure facilities, staff, and residents have been educated on the updated guidance and CDC recommendations.

Chicago has updated vaccine eligibility to include any gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men and transgender persons who are sexually active AND have not previously been infected with MPV, as well continuing to prioritize close contacts (e.g., household members with close physical contact or intimate partners) of someone diagnosed with MPV regardless of sex, gender, or sexual orientation.
* Patients with lesions or pain that interfere with the activities of daily living and patients at high risk for severe disease should be considered for treatment with tecovirimat (TPOXX). There is no shortage of tecovirimat. [See Monkeypox Treatment.](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/treatment.html)

Clinicians are encouraged to include PeV in the differential diagnoses of infants presenting with fever, sepsis-like syndrome, or neurologic illness (seizures, meningitis) without another known cause and to test for PeV in children with signs and symptoms compatible with PeV infection (see below). Commercial laboratory assays, multiplex platforms for meningitis and encephalitis, and testing through state public health laboratories (SPHLs) are available to test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for PeV to confirm a diagnosis. <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/hcp.html"" target=""_blank"">CDC laboratory support</a> is also available for testing and typing patient specimens.</p>

<p>To date, all PeV positive specimens tested and typed at CDC were type PeV-A3. Because there is presently no systematic surveillance for PeVs in the United States, it is not clear how the number of PeV cases reported in 2022 compares to previous seasons. PeV laboratory testing has become more widely available in recent years, and it is possible that increased testing has led to a higher number of PeV diagnoses compared with previous years.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations for Clinicians</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Be aware that PeVs circulate in the summer and fall. In the absence of an identified pathogen, consider PeV infection in a neonate or infant presenting with fever, sepsis-like syndrome, or signs of neurologic involvement.</li>
	<li>Become familiar with <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/lab-testing/specimen-collection.html"" target=""_blank"">specimen collection, storage, and shipping procedures</a>. Testing for PeV is available at commercial clinical laboratories and SPHLs, and hospitals may use multiplex meningitis and encephalitis panels for CSF testing that include PeV. Testing and typing for PeV are also available at CDC when other options are unavailable; clinicians should still work with their state public health department to send specimens to CDC. Please contact <a href=""mailto:PicornaLab@cdc.gov"">PicornaLab@cdc.gov</a> before submitting specimens. Accepted specimens include CSF, throat or nasopharyngeal swabs, blood, and stool.</li>
	<li>Consider cohorting an infant hospitalized with detected PeV infection with other affected infant(s) to avoid healthcare-associated transmission in nurseries or neonatal intensive care units.</li>
	<li>Use <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/basics/transmission-based-precautions.html"" target=""_blank"">Contact, Droplet, and Standard Precautions</a>. In most clinical situations, alcohol-based hand sanitizer (ABHS) is preferred for cleaning hands with an alcohol content of at least 60%. However, soap and water is the preferred method after patient care involving diapering or toileting, before eating or feeding, and if hands are visibly soiled (e.g., dirt, blood, body fluids). Although non-enveloped viruses may be less susceptible to alcohol than enveloped viruses, ABHS offers benefits in skin tolerance, compliance, and overall effectiveness, especially when combined with glove use.

Suspected drug involvement includes heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.</p>

<p>It is important to note that synthetic opioids have been increasingly found in non-opioid substances, including stimulants, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, and party drugs, such as MDMA/Ecstasy. Individuals who use illicit substances should be aware that <u><strong>any</strong></u> substance may contain fentanyl or other potent synthetic opioids. Illicit substances are not regulated and pose significant risk of harm. <u><strong>Extreme caution</strong></u> should be used when using any illicit substance.</p>

<p>If taking illicit substances, there are precautions that can be used to reduce risk for fatal and non-fatal overdose. Consider testing the substance for fentanyl using fentanyl test strips. Carry naloxone and do not use any substance alone. Also, be aware that more than one dose of naloxone may be required to reverse an overdose, especially when synthetic opioids are involved.</p>

<p>Naloxone (opioid reversal agent) should be administered if an opioid overdose is suspected. With the increasing presence of synthetic opioids (i.e. fentanyl) in the drug supply, including other illicit non-opioid substances, additional naloxone should be stocked and users should be aware that more administrations across a longer period of time may be required to reverse an overdose.</p>

* Clinicians should consider influenza testing in addition to SARS-CoV-2 testing and [review guidelines](https://www.chicagohan.org/alert-detail?p_p_id=hanalertdetailsweb&p_p_lifecycle=2&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&p_p_resource_id=download&p_p_cacheability=cacheLevelPage&_hanalertdetailsweb_attachmentId=45691699&_hanalertdetailsweb_alertId=46669192) for prescribing anti-viral medications as prophylaxis or empiric treatment.

**Other Respiratory Viruses:**

* Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity remains low.
* The percent of specimens testing positive for parainfluenza has increased in recent weeks, mainly being driven by parainfluenza type 3 infections which usually occur in the spring and early summer months.

**About this report:** This report summarizes key respiratory virus surveillance indicators. The indicators are compiled from laboratory-based data as well emergency department visit data. This report is meant to provide more context for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, particularly as co-circulation of respiratory viruses increases. More detailed information on [influenza](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/flu/home/chicago-flu-update.html) and [COVID-19](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/covid-dashboard.html) activity can be found on their respective online dashboards. This report is updated on Fridays for the previous Saturday through Sunday. On all graphs, the week ending date is displayed. Ending dates are accurate for the current season but are approximations for all other years. All data presented here are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. Reported percentages for previous seasons represent final, end of season data and may differ from previously published reports.

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is issuing this Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory to update healthcare providers, public health departments, and the public on the potential for recurrence of COVID-19 or “COVID-19 rebound.” Paxlovid continues to be recommended for early-stage treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 among persons at high risk for progression to severe disease. Paxlovid treatment helps prevent hospitalization and death due to COVID-19. COVID-19 rebound has been reported to occur between 2 and 8 days after initial recovery and is characterized by a recurrence of COVID-19 symptoms or a new positive viral test after having tested negative. A brief return of symptoms may be part of the natural history of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) infection in some persons, independent of treatment with Paxlovid and regardless of vaccination status. Limited information currently available from case reports suggests that persons treated with Paxlovid who experience COVID-19 rebound have had mild illness; there are no reports of severe disease. There is currently no evidence that additional treatment is needed with Paxlovid or other anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies in cases where COVID-19 rebound is suspected.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether the patient has been treated with an antiviral agent, risk of transmission during COVID-19 rebound can be managed by following <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/your-health/quarantine-isolation.html"" target=""_blank"">CDC’s guidance on isolation</a>, including taking other precautions such as masking.</p>

<p>Staying <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html"" target=""_blank"">up to date</a> with COVID-19 vaccination lowers the risk of getting COVID-19 and helps prevent serious outcomes of COVID-19, such as severe illness, hospitalization, and death.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
A person has tested positive for avian influenza A(H5) virus (H5 bird flu) in the U.S., as confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and reported by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment on April 28, 2022. This case occurred in a person who had direct exposure to poultry and who was involved in the culling (depopulating) of poultry with presumptive H5N1 bird flu.</p>

<p>Starting in January, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) detected highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus in wild birds in the United States followed by multiple detections in U.S. commercial poultry and backyard bird flocks [1,2]. Detection of A(H5) virus in one person who was involved in culling of poultry does not change the human health risk assessment, which remains low for the general public. People with work or recreational exposures to infected birds are at greater risk of infection and should follow recommended precautions. The purpose of this HAN Health Advisory is to notify public health workers, clinicians, and the public of the potential for human infection with this virus and to describe the CDC’s recommendations for patient investigation and testing, infection control including the use of personal protective equipment, and antiviral treatment and prophylaxis.</p>

A person has tested positive for avian influenza A(H5) virus (H5 bird flu) in the U.S., as confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and reported by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment on April 28, 2022. This case occurred in a person who had direct exposure to poultry and who was involved in the culling (depopulating) of poultry with presumptive H5N1 bird flu.

Starting in January, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) detected highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus in wild birds in the United States followed by multiple detections in U.S. commercial poultry and backyard bird flocks \[1,2\]. Detection of A(H5) virus in one person who was involved in culling of poultry does not change the human health risk assessment, which remains low for the general public. People with work or recreational exposures to infected birds are at greater risk of infection and should follow recommended precautions. The purpose of this HAN Health Advisory is to notify public health workers, clinicians, and the public of the potential for human infection with this virus and to describe the CDC's recommendations for patient investigation and testing, infection control including the use of personal protective equipment, and antiviral treatment and prophylaxis.

In November 2021, clinicians at a large children’s hospital in Alabama notified CDC of five pediatric patients with significant liver injury, including three with acute liver failure, who also tested positive for adenovirus. All children were previously healthy. None had COVID-19. Case-finding efforts at this hospital identified four additional pediatric patients with hepatitis and adenovirus infection for a total of nine patients admitted from October 2021 through February 2022; all five that were sequenced had adenovirus type 41 infection identified.

Xylazine-involved overdoses and deaths are increasing in Illinois.

* ++Healthcare providers should:++

• Consider xylazine in human poly drug use, especially when standard doses of naloxone are ineffective.

• Be aware of evolving treatment recommendations.

• Educate patients who use illicit drugs about the risks of xylazine exposure in fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, and 'tranq' use.

* ++Harm Reduction programs should:++

• Prepare for potentially larger naloxone distribution and use needs.

• Deliver appropriate wound care.

• Educate patients who use illicit drugs about the risks of xylazine exposure in fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, and 'tranq' use.

CDC HAN: Expansion of Recall of LeadCare Blood Lead Tests Due to Risk of Falsely Low Results,2021-10-14T17:47:16.000,46668681,Lead Testing,Diseases & Conditions,Low,CDC HAN: Expansion of Recall of LeadCare Blood Lead Tests Due to Risk of Falsely Low Results,"<p><strong>Summary&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Magellan Diagnostics, Inc. and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have issued notifications about the expansion of Magellan Diagnostics’ recall of LeadCare II, LeadCare Plus, and LeadCare Ultra Blood Lead Tests, which were distributed from October 27, 2020, to August 19, 2021. Additional LeadCare II product lots, including lots previously reported to be unaffected, were recalled due to a significant risk of falsely low results. The use of these devices may cause serious injuries because they might underestimate blood lead levels. FDA has identified this as a Class I recall, the most serious type of recall.</p>

<p>The CDC issused a Health Update to notify healthcare providers and state and local health departments about the expansion of the recall notice and to recommend appropriate follow-up actions in the shortage of LeadCare Lead Tests. This HAN Health Update is an update to <a href=""https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2021/han00445.asp"" target=""_blank"">HAN Health Advisory 445: Recall of LeadCare Blood Lead Tests Due to Risk of Falsely Low Results</a>&nbsp;(issued&nbsp;July 6, 2021).</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations for Clinicians</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Continue to schedule and perform required blood lead tests for patients. A venous or capillary blood sample analyzed using higher complexity methods such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) or graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) from a CLIA compliant clinical laboratory should be used if LeadCare lead test kits are unavailable. &nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li><u>Note:</u> In accordance with Section 6.2 of the Lead Poisoning Prevention Act (LPPA) and Section 845.55 of the Lead Poisoning Prevention Code (LPPC), all children 6 years of age and younger and pregnant people, upon evaluation from the provider using the Childhood Lead Risk Questionnaire or Prenatal-risk Evaluation of Lead Exposure, shall receive a blood lead test. The results of these analyses shall be reported to IDPH in accordance with Section 7 of the LPPA and Section 845.60 of the LPPC. These testing requirements have NOT been waived. The lead portion of the Certificate of Child Health Examination shall be completed in accordance with these requirements as well. Until such time as the test kits supply shortage for LeadCare II units has been remedied by the manufacturer, providers will need to contact a certified reference laboratory to perform analyses of samples taken in their offices.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Discontinue using all <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-recalls/magellan-diagnostics-recalls-leadcare-ii-leadcare-plus-and-leadcare-ultra-blood-lead-tests-due-risk"" target=""_blank"">test kit lots</a> identified as part of the recall.&nbsp;</li>

Retesting should be done with a venous blood sample analyzed with higher complexity testing.&nbsp;</li>

Magellan Diagnostics, Inc. and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have issued notifications about the expansion of Magellan Diagnostics' recall of LeadCare II, LeadCare Plus, and LeadCare Ultra Blood Lead Tests, which were distributed from October 27, 2020, to August 19, 2021. Additional LeadCare II product lots, including lots previously reported to be unaffected, were recalled due to a significant risk of falsely low results. The use of these devices may cause serious injuries because they might underestimate blood lead levels. FDA has identified this as a Class I recall, the most serious type of recall.

The CDC issused a Health Update to notify healthcare providers and state and local health departments about the expansion of the recall notice and to recommend appropriate follow-up actions in the shortage of LeadCare Lead Tests. This HAN Health Update is an update to [HAN Health Advisory 445: Recall of LeadCare Blood Lead Tests Due to Risk of Falsely Low Results](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2021/han00445.asp) (issued July 6, 2021).

**Recommendations for Clinicians**

* Continue to schedule and perform required blood lead tests for patients. A venous or capillary blood sample analyzed using higher complexity methods such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) or graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) from a CLIA compliant clinical laboratory should be used if LeadCare lead test kits are unavailable.
  * ++Note:++ In accordance with Section 6.2 of the Lead Poisoning Prevention Act (LPPA) and Section 845.55 of the Lead Poisoning Prevention Code (LPPC), all children 6 years of age and younger and pregnant people, upon evaluation from the provider using the Childhood Lead Risk Questionnaire or Prenatal-risk Evaluation of Lead Exposure, shall receive a blood lead test. The results of these analyses shall be reported to IDPH in accordance with Section 7 of the LPPA and Section 845.60 of the LPPC. These testing requirements have NOT been waived. The lead portion of the Certificate of Child Health Examination shall be completed in accordance with these requirements as well. Until such time as the test kits supply shortage for LeadCare II units has been remedied by the manufacturer, providers will need to contact a certified reference laboratory to perform analyses of samples taken in their offices.
* Discontinue using all [test kit lots](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-recalls/magellan-diagnostics-recalls-leadcare-ii-leadcare-plus-and-leadcare-ultra-blood-lead-tests-due-risk) identified as part of the recall.
* Retest children who were tested with the recalled LeadCare lead test kits whose results were less than CDC's [blood lead reference value](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/data/blood-lead-reference-value.htm). Retesting should be done with a venous blood sample analyzed with higher complexity testing.
* Retest children who were previously tested with a LeadCare test kit if the lot number of the initial test kit is unknown and the test was done after October 27, 2020.
* Prioritize testing for:
  * Children where there is clinical concern that symptoms or developmental problems may be related to lead exposure,
  * Populations at higher risk of elevated blood lead levels, such as children tested due to Medicaid-required screening or due to other state or local requirements,
  * Individuals who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and
  * Children who are immigrants, refugees, or recently adopted from outside of the United States.
* Discuss the recall and retesting recommendations with a parent or caregiver of children who meet the retesting criteria.
* Follow recommendations for [best practices](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/lab/default.htm) when collecting a capillary blood sample for lead testing.

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that clinicians be on alert for cases of measles that meet the <a href=""https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/measles-2013/"" target=""_blank"">case definition</a>, as well as other infectious diseases, including <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/hcp.html"" target=""_blank"">mumps</a>, <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/health_professionals/index.html"" target=""_blank"">leishmaniasis</a>, and <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment/index.html"" target=""_blank"">malaria</a>, among evacuees (including both Afghan nationals and U.S. citizens) from Afghanistan. Clinicians should immediately notify their local or state health department of any suspected cases of measles. Clinicians should also recommend the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine for unvaccinated patients. Measles is an extremely contagious infectious disease; around 9 out of 10 people who are close contacts and who are not protected will become infected following exposure to measles virus. As of September 20, 2021, CDC has been notified of 16 confirmed cases of measles and 4 cases of mumps among Afghan nationals and U.S. citizens, recently arriving from Afghanistan and continued vigilance is needed. In addition to MMR vaccination, CDC recommends that evacuees are also up to date on vaccinations for varicella, polio, COVID-19, and seasonal influenza.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Reminder for Chicago Providers</strong>:&nbsp;Healthcare providers should contact Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) immediately (call 311 and ask for the communicable disease physician on call) if cases of paralytic polio disease or measles are suspected in individuals arriving from Afghanistan. Providers should report suspected or confirmed cases of active TB disease within 24 hours by calling the disease reporting line at (312) 743-9000.</p>

**Summary**

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that clinicians be on alert for cases of measles that meet the [case definition](https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/measles-2013/), as well as other infectious diseases, including [mumps](https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/hcp.html), [leishmaniasis](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/leishmaniasis/health_professionals/index.html), and [malaria](https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/diagnosis_treatment/index.html), among evacuees (including both Afghan nationals and U.S. citizens) from Afghanistan. Clinicians should immediately notify their local or state health department of any suspected cases of measles. Clinicians should also recommend the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine for unvaccinated patients. Measles is an extremely contagious infectious disease; around 9 out of 10 people who are close contacts and who are not protected will become infected following exposure to measles virus. As of September 20, 2021, CDC has been notified of 16 confirmed cases of measles and 4 cases of mumps among Afghan nationals and U.S. citizens, recently arriving from Afghanistan and continued vigilance is needed. In addition to MMR vaccination, CDC recommends that evacuees are also up to date on vaccinations for varicella, polio, COVID-19, and seasonal influenza.

**Reminder for Chicago Providers**: Healthcare providers should contact Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) immediately (call 311 and ask for the communicable disease physician on call) if cases of paralytic polio disease or measles are suspected in individuals arriving from Afghanistan.

<p>Please see the attached for more&nbsp;details.</p>","**Summary**   

Ivermectin is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription medication used to treat certain infections caused by internal and external parasites. When used as prescribed for approved indications, it is generally safe and well tolerated.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, ivermectin dispensing by retail pharmacies has increased, as has use of veterinary formulations available over the counter but not intended for human use. FDA has cautioned about the potential risks of use for prevention or treatment of COVID-19.

Ivermectin is not authorized or approved by FDA for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. The National Institutes of Health's (NIH) COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel has also determined that there are currently insufficient data to recommend ivermectin for treatment of COVID-19. ClinicalTrials.gov has listings of ongoing clinical trials that might provide more information about these hypothesized uses in the future.

Adverse effects associated with ivermectin misuse and overdose are increasing, as shown by a rise in calls to poison control centers reporting overdoses and more people experiencing adverse effects.

**Recommendations for Clinicians and Public Health Practitioners**

* Be aware that ivermectin is not currently authorized or approved by FDA for treatment of COVID-19. NIH has also determined that there are currently insufficient data to recommend ivermectin for treatment of COVID-19.
* Educate patients about the risks of using ivermectin without a prescription, or ingesting ivermectin formulations that are meant for external use or ivermectin-containing products formulated for veterinary use.
* Advise patients to immediately seek medical treatment if they have taken any ivermectin or ivermectin-containing products and are experiencing symptoms. Signs and symptoms of ivermectin toxicity include gastrointestinal effects (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), headache, blurred vision, dizziness, tachycardia, hypotension, visual hallucinations, altered mental status, confusion, loss of coordination and balance, central nervous system depression, and seizures. Ivermectin may increase sedative effects of other medications such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Call the poison control center hotline (1-800-222-1222) for medical management advice.
* Educate patients and the public to get vaccinated against COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination is safe and the most effective means to prevent infection and protect against severe disease and death from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, including the Delta variant.
* Educate patients and the public to use COVID-19 prevention measures including wearing masks in indoor public places, physical distancing by staying at least six feet from other people who don't live in the same household, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, and frequent handwashing and use of hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol.

New Case Id'd: Multistate Investigation of Non-travel Associated Burkholderia pseudomallei Infec.,2021-08-09T16:35:11.000,46667418,Bacterial,Diseases & Conditions,Low,"New Case Identified: Multistate Investigation of Non-travel Associated Burkholderia pseudomallei Infections (Melioidosis) in Four Patients: Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas - 2021","<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
The Georgia Department of Public Health, with assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is investigating a fatal case of <em>Burkholderia pseudomallei</em> infection (i.e., melioidosis) identified in late July 2021. Based on genomic analysis, this case in Georgia closely matches the three cases previously identified in Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas in 2021, indicating they all most likely share a common source of exposure. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment, the Minnesota Department of Health, and the Texas Department of State Health Services continue to investigate the three previous cases with assistance from CDC. The four cases include both children and adults. Two cases are female, and two cases are male. The first case, which was fatal, was identified in March 2021 in Kansas. The second and third cases, both identified in May 2021 in Minnesota and Texas, were hospitalized for extended periods of time before being discharged to transitional care facilities. The most recent case died in the hospital and was identified post-mortem in late July 2021 in Georgia. None of the cases had a history of traveling outside of the continental United States. Symptoms of melioidosis are varied and nonspecific, and may include pneumonia, abscess formation, and blood infections. Due to its nonspecific symptoms, melioidosis can initially be mistaken for other diseases such as tuberculosis, which can delay proper treatment. B. pseudomallei may also be misidentified by some automated identification methods in laboratory settings. This Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Update serves as an update to <a href=""https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2021/han00444.asp"" target=""_blank"">HAN Health Advisory Multistate Investigation of Non-travel Associated Burkholderia pseudomallei Infections (Melioidosis) in Three Patients: Kansas, Texas, and Minnesota—2021</a> that CDC issued on June 30, 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Recommendations</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Consider melioidosis diagnosis in patients with a compatible illness, even if they do not have a travel history to a disease-endemic country.</li>
	<li>Culture of <em>B. pseudomallei</em> from any clinical specimen is considered diagnostic for melioidosis. Ideal specimens for culture include blood, urine, throat swab, and, when relevant, respiratory specimens, abscesses, or wound swabs.</li>
	<li>When ordering specimen cultures to diagnose melioidosis, advise the laboratory that cultures may grow <em>B. pseudomallei</em>, and that appropriate laboratory safety precautions should be observed by the laboratory personnel.</li>
	<li>Laboratory testing involving automated identification algorithms (e.g., MALDI-TOF, 16s, VITEK-2) may misidentify <em>B. pseudomallei</em> as another bacterium. The isolate from the Texas case was initially misidentified as <em>B. thailandensis</em> by MALDI-TOF. Consider re-evaluating patients with isolates identified on automated systems as <em>Burkholderia spp</em>. (specifically <em>B. cepacia</em> and <em>B. thailandensis</em>), <em>Chromobacterium violaceum, Ochrobactrum anthropi</em>; and, possibly, <em>Pseudomonas spp</em>., <em>Acinetobacter spp</em>., and <em>Aeromonas spp</em>.</li>
	<li>Treat melioidosis with IV antibiotics (e.g., ceftazidime or meropenem) for at least two weeks. Depending on the response to therapy, IV treatment may be extended for up to eight weeks.

The Georgia Department of Public Health, with assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is investigating a fatal case of *Burkholderia pseudomallei* infection (i.e., melioidosis) identified in late July 2021. Based on genomic analysis, this case in Georgia closely matches the three cases previously identified in Kansas, Minnesota, and Texas in 2021, indicating they all most likely share a common source of exposure. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment, the Minnesota Department of Health, and the Texas Department of State Health Services continue to investigate the three previous cases with assistance from CDC. The four cases include both children and adults. Two cases are female, and two cases are male. The first case, which was fatal, was identified in March 2021 in Kansas. The second and third cases, both identified in May 2021 in Minnesota and Texas, were hospitalized for extended periods of time before being discharged to transitional care facilities. The most recent case died in the hospital and was identified post-mortem in late July 2021 in Georgia. None of the cases had a history of traveling outside of the continental United States. Symptoms of melioidosis are varied and nonspecific, and may include pneumonia, abscess formation, and blood infections. Due to its nonspecific symptoms, melioidosis can initially be mistaken for other diseases such as tuberculosis, which can delay proper treatment. B. pseudomallei may also be misidentified by some automated identification methods in laboratory settings. This Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Update serves as an update to [HAN Health Advisory Multistate Investigation of Non-travel Associated Burkholderia pseudomallei Infections (Melioidosis) in Three Patients: Kansas, Texas, and Minnesota---2021](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2021/han00444.asp) that CDC issued on June 30, 2021.

<br />


**Recommendations**

* Consider melioidosis diagnosis in patients with a compatible illness, even if they do not have a travel history to a disease-endemic country.
* Culture of *B. pseudomallei* from any clinical specimen is considered diagnostic for melioidosis. Ideal specimens for culture include blood, urine, throat swab, and, when relevant, respiratory specimens, abscesses, or wound swabs.
* When ordering specimen cultures to diagnose melioidosis, advise the laboratory that cultures may grow *B. pseudomallei*, and that appropriate laboratory safety precautions should be observed by the laboratory personnel.
* Laboratory testing involving automated identification algorithms (e.g., MALDI-TOF, 16s, VITEK-2) may misidentify *B. pseudomallei* as another bacterium. The isolate from the Texas case was initially misidentified as *B. thailandensis* by MALDI-TOF. Consider re-evaluating patients with isolates identified on automated systems as *Burkholderia spp* . (specifically *B. cepacia* and *B. thailandensis* ), *Chromobacterium violaceum, Ochrobactrum anthropi* ; and, possibly, *Pseudomonas spp* ., *Acinetobacter spp* ., and *Aeromonas spp*.
* Treat melioidosis with IV antibiotics (e.g., ceftazidime or meropenem) for at least two weeks. Depending on the response to therapy, IV treatment may be extended for up to eight weeks. Intravenous treatment is followed by oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) for three to six months to prevent relapse. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid can be used in persons with a contraindication to, or who cannot tolerate, TMP/SMX.
* If B. pseudomallei is identified or an organism is suspicious for B. pseudomallei, contact your state or local public health department immediately.

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in collaboration with the Texas Department of State Health Services and Dallas County Health and Human Services, is investigating a single case of monkeypox virus infection in a U.S. citizen who resides in the United States and recently returned from travel to Nigeria. The patient traveled to Dallas from Lagos, Nigeria, via Atlanta on two separate flights during July 8-9, 2021. The patient presented to an emergency department in Dallas, Texas on July 13 for complaints of a rash that began on July 7, one day prior to travel. Testing at Dallas County and CDC confirmed the presence of monkeypox virus.

<ul>
	<li>If clinicians identify patients with a constellation of signs and symptoms that could be monkeypox, a travel history should be solicited.

	<li>Patients with suspected monkeypox should be isolated in a negative pressure room, and all personnel should wear personal protective equipment (PPE) in accordance with recommendations for standard, contact, and airborne precautions3. All healthcare workers (e.g., clinical staff and environmental staff) caring for a patient with suspect or confirmed monkeypox should be communicated the importance of maintaining proper isolation precautions so that infection is not transmitted to them or others.</li>

Multistate Inv. of Non-travel Associated Burkholderia pseudomallei Infections (Melioidosis) in 3 Pts,2021-06-30T22:16:52.000,46666983,Bacterial,Diseases & Conditions,Low,"Multistate Investigation of Non-travel Associated Burkholderia pseudomallei Infections (Melioidosis) in Three Patients: Kansas, Texas, and Minnesota—2021","<p><span style=""font-size:16px""><strong>Summary</strong><br />
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment, the Texas Department of State Health Services, and the Minnesota Department of Health, with assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are investigating three cases of Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis) infections. Based on genomic analysis, these three cases (one male, two females; two adults and one child) may share a potential common source of exposure. The first case, identified in March 2021, was fatal. Two other patients were identified in May 2021, one of whom is still hospitalized. One has been discharged to a transitional care unit. None of the patients’ families reported a history of traveling outside of the continental United States.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:16px"">Symptoms of melioidosis are varied and nonspecific and may include pneumonia, abscess formation, and/or blood infections. Due to its nonspecific symptoms, melioidosis can initially be mistaken for other diseases such as tuberculosis, and proper treatment may be delayed.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:16px""><strong>Recommendations</strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""font-size:16px"">Consider melioidosis in patients with a compatible illness even if they do not have a travel history to a disease-endemic country.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:16px"">Culture of B. pseudomallei from any clinical specimen is considered diagnostic for melioidosis. If melioidosis is suspected, culture blood, urine, throat swab, and, when relevant, respiratory specimens, abscesses, or wound swabs.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:16px"">When ordering specimen cultures to diagnose melioidosis, advise the laboratory that cultures may grow B. pseudomallei, and the laboratory personnel should observe appropriate laboratory safety precautions.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:16px"">Treatment of melioidosis consists of IV antibiotics (i.e., ceftazidime or meropenem) for at least two weeks. Depending on the response to therapy, IV treatment may be extended for up to eight weeks. Intravenous treatment is followed by oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) for 3-6 months to prevent relapse. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid can be used in persons with a contraindication to or who cannot tolerate TMP/SMX3.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:16px"">Consider re-evaluating patients with isolates identified on automated systems as Burkholderia spp. (specifically B. cepacia and B. thailandensis), Chromobacterium violaceum, Ochrobactrum anthropi; and, possibly, Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Aeromonas spp. Laboratory testing involving automated identification algorithms (e.g., MALDI-TOF, 16s, VITEK-2) may misidentify B. pseudomallei as another bacterium. The isolate from the Texas case was initially misidentified as B. thailandensis by MALDI-TOF</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:16px"">If B. pseudomallei is identified or an organism is suspicious for B. pseudomallei, contact your local public health department immediately. The health department can facilitate forwarding the isolate for confirmation to the closest reference laboratory and initiate a public health investigation.</span></li>

None of the patients' families reported a history of traveling outside of the continental United States.

Symptoms of melioidosis are varied and nonspecific and may include pneumonia, abscess formation, and/or blood infections. Due to its nonspecific symptoms, melioidosis can initially be mistaken for other diseases such as tuberculosis, and proper treatment may be delayed.

**Recommendations**

* Consider melioidosis in patients with a compatible illness even if they do not have a travel history to a disease-endemic country.
* Culture of B. pseudomallei from any clinical specimen is considered diagnostic for melioidosis. If melioidosis is suspected, culture blood, urine, throat swab, and, when relevant, respiratory specimens, abscesses, or wound swabs.
* When ordering specimen cultures to diagnose melioidosis, advise the laboratory that cultures may grow B. pseudomallei, and the laboratory personnel should observe appropriate laboratory safety precautions.
* Treatment of melioidosis consists of IV antibiotics (i.e., ceftazidime or meropenem) for at least two weeks. Depending on the response to therapy, IV treatment may be extended for up to eight weeks. Intravenous treatment is followed by oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) for 3-6 months to prevent relapse. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid can be used in persons with a contraindication to or who cannot tolerate TMP/SMX3.
* Consider re-evaluating patients with isolates identified on automated systems as Burkholderia spp. (specifically B. cepacia and B. thailandensis), Chromobacterium violaceum, Ochrobactrum anthropi; and, possibly, Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Aeromonas spp. Laboratory testing involving automated identification algorithms (e.g., MALDI-TOF, 16s, VITEK-2) may misidentify B. pseudomallei as another bacterium. The isolate from the Texas case was initially misidentified as B. thailandensis by MALDI-TOF
* If B. pseudomallei is identified or an organism is suspicious for B. pseudomallei, contact your local public health department immediately. The health department can facilitate forwarding the isolate for confirmation to the closest reference laboratory and initiate a public health investigation.

Based on the increased domestic supply of new respirators approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and consistent with [CDC's updated recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy/index.html), the FDA believes health care personnel and facilities can transition away from using non-NIOSH-approved respirators and from utilizing decontamination and bioburden reduction systems. These crisis capacity conservation strategies have been used to address respirator shortages during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Uninsured or underinsured adults and children 0-18 years old who are uninsured, underinsured, or Medicaid (Title XIX) insured can visit a [CDPH Walk-in Immunization Clinic](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/health-protection/immunizations_walk-inclinics.html) to receive the flu vaccine; currently, two CDPH walk-in clinics have resumed immunization services. To locate the closest City of Chicago clinic or retail pharmacy, go to [www.chicagoflushots.org](https://chicagoflushots.org/).

Visit https://www.chicago.gov/flu for more information on influenza.

**What is the risk?**   

Currently, the risk of influenza infection is low.

**Which influenza strains are circulating?**

For the week of March 28-April 3, 2021, no influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations were reported. Since September 27, 2020, one influenzaassociated ICU hospitalization has been reported.

**Where can I get more information?**

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's [FluView](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm) report provides national updates and trends related to the intensity of influenza activity across the United States, as well as detailed information on antiviral resistance, severity of illness, and other topics. Updates specific to [Illinois](http://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/diseases-and-conditions/influenza/influenza-surveillance) and [Suburban Cook County](https://ccdphcd.shinyapps.io/influenza/)are also available online. Current and archived issues of the Chicago Flu Update can be found on the CDPH website section [Current Flu Situation in Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/supp_info/health-protection/current_flu_situationinchicago.html)

**Reporting Information**   

Healthcare facilities can report cases to the Chicago Department of Public Health via the Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System ([INEDSS](https://dph.partner.illinois.gov/my.policy)). Contact SyndromicSurveillance@cityofchicago.org for more information.

Acute Non-Viral Hepatitis of Unknown Etiology Potentially Associated with an Alkaline Water Product,2021-04-01T16:19:05.000,46665785,Food Borne,,Low,Acute Non-Viral Hepatitis of Unknown Etiology Potentially Associated with an Alkaline Water Product,"<p><strong>Summary</strong><br />
Five cases of acute non-viral hepatitis of unknown etiology in children were reported to the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) between November and December 2020. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is assisting the SNHD in investigating a potential link between these illnesses and the consumption of an alkaline water product called &ldquo;Real Water&rdquo; and other possible etiologies. The purpose of this Health Alert Network (HAN) Advisory is to advise clinicians and health departments to have a high index of suspicion for cases of acute non-viral hepatitis and to report any cases to their local health authority.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong><br />
CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were notified of five cases of acute non-viral hepatitis of unknown etiology in children by the SNHD in Nevada on March 13, 2021. The cases occurred in children ranging in ages from seven months to five years who presented to a hospital between November 10, 2020, and December 3, 2020, with signs and symptoms of vomiting, poor intake, and fatigue. Laboratory testing on the patients showed elevated hepatic transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and a negative viral hepatitis serology panel. All patients required transfers to a pediatric tertiary-care specialty liver unit because of concerns for acute liver failure and the possible need for liver transplantations. All children recovered and were discharged home. In addition to these cases, several adults and other children living in the cases&rsquo; households reported similar but mostly less severe symptoms including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fatigue.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations&nbsp;</strong><strong>For Clinicians&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Counsel your patients (or their caregivers and guardians) to stop drinking, cooking with, or using Real Water until more is known about the cause of the illnesses per FDA recommendations.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Educate your patients on the signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis due to any cause, which may include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, light-colored stools, joint pain, and yellow skin or eyes; and the importance of seeking medical care.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Maintain a high index of suspicion for non-viral hepatitis in your differential diagnosis of acute hepatitis in adults and children presenting with compatible clinical findings.</li>
	<li>Obtain a more detailed exposure history in patients when you suspect acute non-viral hepatitis. Possible etiologies associated with acute non-viral hepatitis include exposure to medications, contaminated water or food, dietary and herbal supplements, traditional or home remedies, wild-growing mushrooms and plants, and chemicals such as metals, solvents, paint thinners, or pesticides.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Obtain early consultation with and/or referral to a gastroenterologist or infectious disease specialist for medical workup and management of patients with signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis.</li>
	<li>Contact your local health authority to report cases of acute non-viral hepatitis of unknown etiology.</li>
	<li>Contact your local poison center&nbsp;for information on chemical or drug-induced liver toxicity and report any cases.</li>

Five cases of acute non-viral hepatitis of unknown etiology in children were reported to the Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) between November and December 2020. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is assisting the SNHD in investigating a potential link between these illnesses and the consumption of an alkaline water product called ""Real Water"" and other possible etiologies. The purpose of this Health Alert Network (HAN) Advisory is to advise clinicians and health departments to have a high index of suspicion for cases of acute non-viral hepatitis and to report any cases to their local health authority.

**Background**   

CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were notified of five cases of acute non-viral hepatitis of unknown etiology in children by the SNHD in Nevada on March 13, 2021. The cases occurred in children ranging in ages from seven months to five years who presented to a hospital between November 10, 2020, and December 3, 2020, with signs and symptoms of vomiting, poor intake, and fatigue.

All patients required transfers to a pediatric tertiary-care specialty liver unit because of concerns for acute liver failure and the possible need for liver transplantations. All children recovered and were discharged home. In addition to these cases, several adults and other children living in the cases' households reported similar but mostly less severe symptoms including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fatigue.

**Recommendations** **For Clinicians**

1. Counsel your patients (or their caregivers and guardians) to stop drinking, cooking with, or using Real Water until more is known about the cause of the illnesses per FDA recommendations.
2. Educate your patients on the signs and symptoms of acute hepatitis due to any cause, which may include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, light-colored stools, joint pain, and yellow skin or eyes; and the importance of seeking medical care.
3. Maintain a high index of suspicion for non-viral hepatitis in your differential diagnosis of acute hepatitis in adults and children presenting with compatible clinical findings.

</div>","CDPH has received another update from CDC about COVID-19 vaccine shipment delays due to ongoing winter storm conditions.

1. **Moderna vaccine:** Moderna vaccines were not shipped on Monday February 15 or Tuesday February 16, and will most likely not ship, February 17, due to adverse weather conditions. Despite working with McKesson and shipping partners to resume operations, CDC anticipates a significant back log of orders for distribution once operations resume and every effort will be made to catch up as soon as possible while safely delivering the vaccines.

<!-- -->

2. **Pfizer vaccin** e: Pfizer vaccines were not shipped out on Monday, February 15 due to weather conditions. A limited number of Pfizer vaccine shipments were processed Tuesday February 16 and a similar plan is in effect for February 17.

CDC stated that ""there is an expectation that delays related to this historic weather event will continue through this week"".

Thank you for your continued patience and fortitude in using doses-on-hand from canceled appointments, rescheduling anxious patients, and converting appointments to waiting list placements.

CDPH stands with you throughout this brutal winter and the vaccine management unit will continue daily emails around noon to keep you updated.

Typhi should be reported to the Chicago Department of Public Health through the I-NEDSS system or call the provider reporting line at 312-743-9000.</strong></p>

<p>Recommendations for Clinicians</p>

<ul>
	<li>Consider that typhoid fever symptoms and clinical presentation may resemble those of other febrile infectious diseases.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Obtain a 30-day international travel history from all patients with suspected or confirmed typhoid fever.
	<ul>
		<li>Although most Typhi infections are acquired during international travel, Typhi can be acquired in the United States.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Order blood cultures if typhoid fever is suspected; multiple cultures are usually needed.</li>
	<li>Order antimicrobial susceptibility testing for Typhi isolates and adjust treatment accordingly.</li>
	<li><strong>Consider the following in the selection of empiric treatment for patients with typhoid fever while awaiting susceptibility testing results and when the patient is&nbsp;not linked to a culture-confirmed case of typhoid fever with a known antimicrobial resistance profile.</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>U.S. patients who did not travel outside the United States in the 30 days before illness began: Patients might be infected with XDR Typhi. Consider prescribing a carbapenem (particularly if patients have severe or complicated illness) or azithromycin for empiric treatment.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>U.S. patients who traveled to Pakistan in the 30 days before illness began: Most patients are infected with XDR Typhi. Prescribe a carbapenem (particularly if patients have severe or complicated illness) or azithromycin for empiric treatment.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>U.S. patients who traveled to Iraq in the 30 days before illness began: Most patients have strains that are resistant or have reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin; some strains are also resistant to ampicillin and ceftriaxone. Consider prescribing a carbapenem (particularly if patients have severe or complicated illness) or azithromycin for empiric treatment.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>U.S. patients who traveled to countries other than Pakistan and Iraq in the 30 days before illness began: Most patients have strains that are susceptible to ceftriaxone, which remains an appropriate empiric treatment option.</strong></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Vaccinate patients who are at high risk for typhoid fever, including those traveling to parts of the world where typhoid fever is common, those in close contact&nbsp;with a typhoid carrier, and those who might work with Typhi in a laboratory.</li>
	<li>Counsel travelers about safe eating and drinking practices and advise them that vaccination is not 100% effective. People can become infected with Typhi through&nbsp;contaminated food and water and through person-to-person contact.</li>
	<li>Follow local health department requirements for reporting typhoid fever, which is a nationally notifiable illness. Because of the risk of asymptomatic carriage after&nbsp;recovery, many health departments recommend follow-up testing to ensure microbiological cure before people in high-risk occupations, such as food&nbsp;handlers, daycare workers, and healthcare workers, return to work.</li>

These efforts are critical to the health of our residents and workforce, as well as Chicago&rsquo;s economic recovery from this devastating pandemic. Life will not suddenly return to normal, but COVID-19 vaccination is the light at the end of the tunnel. You have a critically important role in this effort, as a highly trusted source of information for your patients and others in the communities in which you live and work. We want to partner with as many of you as possible in vaccination efforts and vaccine safety monitoring.</p>

<p>Vaccination is beginning now with frontline healthcare workers in Chicago hospitals and long-term care facilities and will begin to expand to higher-risk healthcare workers in other healthcare settings over the next month. We anticipate it will take a few months to be able to offer vaccine to all of Chicago&rsquo;s 400,000 healthcare workers.</p>

<p>Vaccination of staff from Chicago health care facilities that are <u>not</u> hospitals or long-term care facilities1 will take place at CDPH mass vaccination clinics, facility-based clinics and hospital -based clinics, beginning in early 2021. <strong>We strongly encourage you to work with a hospital affiliated with your facility to get your staff vaccinated whenever possible</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>To support CDPH&rsquo;s operational planning around where and how your staff will be vaccinated, each Chicago facility must complete the REDCap Facility Vaccination Planning Survey, at </strong><a href=""https://redcap.link/StaffVaccinationInquirySurvey"" target=""_blank"">https://redcap.link/StaffVaccinationInquirySurvey</a> by January 1, 2020. Each physical location should assign one administrator to complete the survey. <strong>Failure to complete this survey will result in delays in staff vaccination.</strong> Based on your responses to this survey, if it is determined that your facility should be enrolled as a COVID-19 vaccinator, you will also be directed to complete the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement and Provider Profile, at <a href=""https://www.chicagohan.org/covidvax"" target=""_blank"">https://www.chicagohan.org/covidvax.</a></p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong>:&nbsp;Monitoring vaccine safety is a vital part of the nation&rsquo;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As COVID-19 vaccines become available, the public&rsquo;s knowledge and confidence in their safety, both initially and during extended use, is an important part of a successful national vaccination effort.&nbsp;CDC remains committed to ensuring that public health officials, healthcare providers, and the public have accurate and timely information on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>During this COCA call, clinicians will learn how they can educate their patients about what to expect after COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, they will learn how they can play an important role in monitoring the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. This includes encouraging patients to enroll in v-safe, a&nbsp;new&nbsp;smartphone-based, after-vaccination health checker for people who receive COVID-19 vaccines,&nbsp;and to use v-safe to&nbsp;report how they&rsquo;re feeling. Clinicians also will learn how to&nbsp;report adverse events (possible side effects) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Manufacturer COVID-19 Vaccine Training &amp; Education Series</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This week, Pfizer will be hosting a series of training sessions to review information and answer questions about their COVID-19 vaccine.

**12/13/20 COVID Vaccine Updates**

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has released it's interim recommendations for use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine by MMWR Early Release. The recommendation for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine should be implemented in conjunction with ACIP's interim recommendation for allocating initial supplies of COVID-19 vaccines.

View the full report *The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' Interim Recommendation for Use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine --- United States, December 2020* at <https://go.usa.gov/xAx6w>.

**REMINDER: Tomorrow's CDC COVID-19 Vaccine COCA Call**

**[What Every Clinician Should Know about COVID-19 Vaccine Safety](https://emergency.cdc.gov/coca/calls/2020/callinfo_121420.asp)**

**Date**: Monday, December 14, 2020

**Time:**1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) / 12:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. (Central Time)

**Webinar Link** :<https://www.zoomgov.com/j/1611264903>

**Dial-in:**US: +1 669 254 5252 or +1 646 828 7666

**iPhone one-tap:**US: +16692545252,,1611264903# or +16468287666,,1611264903#

**International numbers available:** <https://www.zoomgov.com/u/ab3Ojj4XMn>

**Webinar ID:**161 126 4903

If you are unable to attend the live COCA Call, it will be available for viewing on the [COCA website](https://emergency.cdc.gov/coca/calls/index.asp) a few hours after the live event ends.

**Overview**: Monitoring vaccine safety is a vital part of the nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As COVID-19 vaccines become available, the public's knowledge and confidence in their safety, both initially and during extended use, is an important part of a successful national vaccination effort. CDC remains committed to ensuring that public health officials, healthcare providers, and the public have accurate and timely information on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.

During this COCA call, clinicians will learn how they can educate their patients about what to expect after COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, they will learn how they can play an important role in monitoring the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. This includes encouraging patients to enroll in v-safe, a new smartphone-based, after-vaccination health checker for people who receive COVID-19 vaccines, and to use v-safe to report how they're feeling. Clinicians also will learn how to report adverse events (possible side effects) to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

**Manufacturer COVID-19 Vaccine Training \& Education Series**

This week, Pfizer will be hosting a series of training sessions to review information and answer questions about their COVID-19 vaccine. Please share these training opportunities with clinicians and COVID-19 vaccine providers. Please click on the link below to join the sessions at the designated times.

* Order vaccines and associated supplies (e.g., syringes, needles, personal protective equipment).
* Ensure cold chain management for vaccine.
* Provide on-site administration of vaccine.
* Report required vaccination data (approximately 20 data fields) to the local, state/territorial, and federal jurisdictions within 72 hours of administering each dose.
* Adhere to all applicable Centers for Medicare \& Medicaid (CMS) COVID-19 testing requirements for LTCF staff.

As we prepare for influenza season and develop city-wide COVID-19 vaccination plans, the Chicago Department of Public Health is requesting the action of all LTCF partners to help assist with the COVID-19 response, by completing the following [REDCap survey](https://redcap.dph.illinois.gov/surveys/?s=JYCJW7WTD7) , attached in this message.

During the 2020-2021 cold and influenza season, ensuring widespread annual influenza vaccination participation is more important than ever to protect vulnerable populations. The Chicago Department of Public Health is conducting a large scale influenza vaccination campaign as part of a comprehensive public health strategy to reduce the burden of influenza, but also to preserve scarce health care resources for care of patients with COVID-19.

This survey will help us better understand your facility, your vaccination protocols and plans, and identify any needs within your facility to optimize the availability and administration of vaccine to all of your staff and residents. If you have any questions regarding this survey, please contact Faye Thanas ([Faye.Thanas@cityofchicago.org](mailto:Faye.Thanas@cityofchicago.org))

[REDCap survey](https://redcap.dph.illinois.gov/surveys/?s=JYCJW7WTD7)

Thank you for your continued efforts and assistance during this unprecedented time.

Respectfully,

The Chicago Department of Public Health

IDPH Division of Laboratories Announces COVID-19 Test Ordering Portal,2020-08-05T15:05:11.000,46663787,Laboratory Information,,Low,IDPH Division of Laboratories Announces COVID-19 Test Ordering Portal,"<p>To improve efficiency across IDPH labs, the Illinois Department of Public Health has implemented the IL ETOR portal (Illinois Electronic Test Ordering and Reporting portal).</p>

<p>ETOR is a web-based portal that will allow a submitter to enter all the necessary data to submit a COVID sample electronically on a laptop, tablet, or desktop. Once the submission is complete, the printed ETOR order form must accompany the sample to the lab. The patient data is electronically transferred to the IDPH lab where the specimen will be processed. In ETOR, the submitter can view when the sample has been received at the designated IDPH lab along with real-time testing progress. Once testing is complete, the laboratory releases results into the portal as a PDF which can be downloaded for quick access and follow up with the patient.</p>

<p>There are many benefits of ETOR for both the provider and the IDPH lab system:</p>

<p>1) ETOR expedites the data processing and improves turnaround times.<br />
2) ETOR allows the provider to track the status of the specimen in the portal and know when it has been received at the lab.<br />
3) ETOR uses electronic data entry which results in better quality data.<br />
4) ETOR allows for quick access to laboratory results since they are available on the portal as soon as they are released from the lab.<br />
5) ETOR maintains historical results for patients for tracking and reprinting for specimens submitted using this system.</p>

<p>Enrollment and use of this system is critical to the Division of Laboratories&rsquo; ability to maintain quick turnaround times while increasing testing capacity. Our goal is to transition submitters to use of this system by September 1, 2020. To enroll your facility in the IL ETOR portal or if you have further questions, please email <a href=""mailto:DPH.LABS.DMG@illinois.gov"">DPH.LABS.DMG@illinois.gov</a> and a ETOR project manager will contact you.</p>

	<li>As contact tracing efforts expand, Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) interim COVID-19 testing guidance now recommends testing of all individuals with close contact to a confirmed case of COVID-19.</li>
	<li>CDPH interim guidance now recommends that asymptomatic contacts be tested during their 14-day quarantine period, ideally between days 5 and 9 after exposure to a positive case.</li>
	<li>A negative result does not rule out developing COVID-19 disease and does not clear a close contact to return to work, school or public places sooner than 14 days from the date of last exposure. Quarantine for 14 days is essential to continue to monitor for symptoms.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Healthcare providers may field increased volume of referrals for testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic exposed individuals from all reopened congregate settings but childcare settings in particular.&nbsp;</li>

Travel Order: Frequently Asked Questions Related to Healthcare Personnel,2020-07-07T21:03:37.000,46663382,COVID19,,Low,Travel Order: Frequently Asked Questions Related to Healthcare Personnel,"<p>Last week, CDPH issued Public Health Order 2020-10, which ordered self-quarantine for travelers coming to Chicago from COVID-19 high burden states. &nbsp;The alert below provides guidance specific to health care workers.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>What are the guidelines for Healthcare workers who travel to an identified state for personal reasons?</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
It is recommended that healthcare workers who traveled for personal reasons are quarantined for 14 days from the date of return. &nbsp;However, a healthcare system can implement a testing and monitoring program as defined below. If a healthcare worker returns from travel for personal reasons from a state with an identified high burden, PCR based testing can be performed on days 5-7 after returning. &nbsp;If the test is negative, then the healthcare worker can return to work on day 8. &nbsp;<u>The following criteria must be met, however:</u></p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px"">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The returning traveler must not have had close prolonged contact with a known, confirmed case of COVID-19<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The returning traveler has no known symptoms<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Universal precautions are in place while at work<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The healthcare system offers the test, and monitors the returning traveler&rsquo;s symptoms. &nbsp;If any symptoms occur, the Healthcare worker must stop working, and be re-tested.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>What are the guidelines for healthcare workers who are traveling for essential work?</strong></p>

<p><br />
For purposes of the Order and this FAQ, &ldquo;essential workers&rdquo; are not subject to the mandatory self-quarantine if they are traveling for work purposes under the following circumstances:</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px""><br />
(a) if a non-resident of Chicago, is traveling from a designated state to Chicago for the primary purpose of carrying out primary work in Chicago, and who needs to be physically present in Chicago in order to carry out that primary work, with identification issued by their employer, or</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px""><br />
(b) if a resident of Chicago, is returning from a designated state, and was in the designated state for the primary purpose of carrying out primary work in that state, and who needed to be physically present in that state in order to carry out that primary work.</p>

<p><br />
Essential workers traveling for work purposes are subject to the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Essential workers should avoid any non-essential interactions until the quarantine period has ended. They must limit their activities to work-related activities and functions that directly support their work-related activities, and avoid public spaces as much as possible.</li>
	<li>Essential workers should monitor temperature and signs of symptoms, wear a face covering when in public, maintain social distance, and clean and disinfect workspaces.</li>
	<li>Essential workers are required, to the extent possible, to avoid extended periods in public, contact with strangers, and large congregate settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What if a healthcare worker lives in a state identified as a high burden state?</strong></p>

<p><br />
Healthcare workers are considered exempt if traveling to Chicago for work. Thus, they would be exempt from the quarantine order.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>What if a healthcare worker lives in a Chicago suburb and travels to a high burden state?</strong></p>

<p><br />
If travel is for personal reasons, the order is still applicable. &nbsp;If the travel is for essential work, they are considered exempt from the order.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>How will states be designated under the Order?</strong></p>

<p><br />
A state will be designated if it has a case rate greater than 15 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 resident population, per day, over a 7-day rolling average.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>How and when will the list be updated?</strong></p>

<p><br />
The list of states will be reviewed and amended every Tuesday, starting July 14, 2020, with the order effective for those states the following Friday (three days later).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>","Last week, CDPH issued Public Health Order 2020-10, which ordered self-quarantine for travelers coming to Chicago from COVID-19 high burden states. The alert below provides guidance specific to health care workers.

<br />


**What are the guidelines for Healthcare workers who travel to an identified state for personal reasons?**   

<br />


It is recommended that healthcare workers who traveled for personal reasons are quarantined for 14 days from the date of return. However, a healthcare system can implement a testing and monitoring program as defined below. If a healthcare worker returns from travel for personal reasons from a state with an identified high burden, PCR based testing can be performed on days 5-7 after returning. If the test is negative, then the healthcare worker can return to work on day 8. ++The following criteria must be met, however:++

1. The returning traveler must not have had close prolonged contact with a known, confirmed case of COVID-19  

2. The returning traveler has no known symptoms  

3. Universal precautions are in place while at work  

4. The healthcare system offers the test, and monitors the returning traveler's symptoms. If any symptoms occur, the Healthcare worker must stop working, and be re-tested.

<br />


**What are the guidelines for healthcare workers who are traveling for essential work?**

<br />


For purposes of the Order and this FAQ, ""essential workers"" are not subject to the mandatory self-quarantine if they are traveling for work purposes under the following circumstances:

<br />


(a) if a non-resident of Chicago, is traveling from a designated state to Chicago for the primary purpose of carrying out primary work in Chicago, and who needs to be physically present in Chicago in order to carry out that primary work, with identification issued by their employer, or

<br />


(b) if a resident of Chicago, is returning from a designated state, and was in the designated state for the primary purpose of carrying out primary work in that state, and who needed to be physically present in that state in order to carry out that primary work.

<br />


Essential workers traveling for work purposes are subject to the following requirements:

* Essential workers should avoid any non-essential interactions until the quarantine period has ended. They must limit their activities to work-related activities and functions that directly support their work-related activities, and avoid public spaces as much as possible.
* Essential workers should monitor temperature and signs of symptoms, wear a face covering when in public, maintain social distance, and clean and disinfect workspaces.
* Essential workers are required, to the extent possible, to avoid extended periods in public, contact with strangers, and large congregate settings.

**What if a healthcare worker lives in a state identified as a high burden state?**

<br />


Healthcare workers are considered exempt if traveling to Chicago for work. Thus, they would be exempt from the quarantine order.

<br />


**What if a healthcare worker lives in a Chicago suburb and travels to a high burden state?**

<br />


If travel is for personal reasons, the order is still applicable. If the travel is for essential work, they are considered exempt from the order.

<br />


**How will states be designated under the Order?**

<br />


A state will be designated if it has a case rate greater than 15 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 resident population, per day, over a 7-day rolling average.

<br />


**How and when will the list be updated?**

<br />


The list of states will be reviewed and amended every Tuesday, starting July 14, 2020, with the order effective for those states the following Friday (three days later).

<br />

<ul>
	<li><span style=""font-size:14px"">Scheduling well visits in the morning and sick visits in the afternoon</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:14px"">Separating patients spatially, such as by placing patients with sick visits in different areas of the clinic or another location from patients with well visits.</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:14px"">Collaborating with providers in the community to identify separate locations for holding well visits for children.</span></li>

<p><span style=""font-size:14px"">Because of personal, practice, or community circumstances related to COVID-19, some providers may not be able to provide well child visits, including provision of immunizations, for all patients in their practice.

<p><span style=""font-size:14px"">Delivery of some clinical preventive services for adults, such as immunizations, requires face-to-face encounters and in areas with community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, these should be postponed except when:</span></p>

Clinicians must maintain access to clinical services in environments that are safe for all. Some of the [strategies](https://www.acponline.org/acp_policy/policies/statement_on_non_urgent_in-person_medical_care_2020.pdf) used to slow the spread of disease in communities include postponing or cancelling non-urgent elective procedures and using telemedicine instead of face-to-face encounters for routine medical encounters.

**Clinics working with children:**

Healthcare providers in communities affected by COVID-19 are using [strategies to separate well visits from sick](https://services.aap.org/en/pages/covid-19-clinical-guidance-q-a/). Examples include:

* Scheduling well visits in the morning and sick visits in the afternoon
* Separating patients spatially, such as by placing patients with sick visits in different areas of the clinic or another location from patients with well visits.
* Collaborating with providers in the community to identify separate locations for holding well visits for children.

Because of personal, practice, or community circumstances related to COVID-19, some providers may not be able to provide well child visits, including provision of immunizations, for all patients in their practice. If a practice can provide only limited well child visits, healthcare providers are encouraged to prioritize newborn care and vaccination of infants and young children (through 24 months of age) when possible.

**Clinics working with adults:**

Delivery of some clinical preventive services for adults, such as immunizations, requires face-to-face encounters and in areas with community transmission of SARS-CoV-2, these should be postponed except when:

* An in-person visit must be scheduled for some other purpose and the clinical preventive service can be delivered during that visit with no additional risk; or
* An individual patient and their clinician believe that there is a compelling need to receive the service based on an assessment that the potential benefit outweighs the risk of exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19

Submitting facilities must ensure they have an authorization number prior to sending the specimens and it must be clearly labeled on the request form. IDPH Lab is implementing a new test request form that can be filled in electronically and printed for submission. It can be found here. We are currently working on a future enhancement that will allow submission information to be transmitted electronically into our database. The submitting facility must contact their local health department to receive the authorization number or request authorization using the online service found here.</p>

<p>Acceptable Media Types:<br />
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently released additional media types that may be used as alternatives for universal transport media (UTM) or viral transport media (VTM), due to a nationwide shortage. A list of acceptable media types can be found in this FAQ here under &ldquo;What If I Do Not Have&hellip;.?&rdquo;.

<ul>
	<li>Transfer of patients with COVID-19 from acute to long-term care facilities (LTCFs) should occur when patients are medically stable after communication between hospital discharge planners and receiving facilities to acknowledge readiness to accept.</li>
	<li>LTCFs should not transfer patients with suspect or confirmed COVID-19 infection unless medically indicated. These patients should be appropriately isolated with contact and droplet precautions implemented.</li>
	<li>LTCF should prepare NOW to receive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from acute care by checking supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE) and diagnostic laboratory testing supplies.</li>

	<li><strong>Patients with positive COVID-19 testing:</strong> A LCTF can accept a resident diagnosed with COVID-19 and still under Transmission Based Precautions for COVID-19 as long as the facility can follow CDC guidance for Droplet and Contact Precautions. If a LTCF cannot, it must wait until these precautions are discontinued. Transmission based precautions may be discontinued as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>1) At least 7 days after symptom onset</li>
		<li>2) Patient afebrile for 72 hours without the use of fever-reducing medications AND improvement in respiratory symptoms</li>
		<li>Reduction in acute care facility capacity is anticipated. LTCFs should prepare now to accept patients requiring strict contact and droplet precautions. CDPH will continue to provide guidance updates informed by local healthcare system capacity.</li>
	</ul>

	<li><strong>Patients under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19, but test results pending:</strong> At this time, PUIs should NOT be transferred to LTCFs until test results are available. As acute care facility capacity changes and there is need to transfer PUIs to LTCFs, CDPH will provide additional guidance on receiving PUIs.</li>

<p>Acute care hospitals should conduct symptom screening of hospitalized patients with respiratory syndromes consistent with COVID-19, and order testing when indicated.

<ul>
	<li>Gives guidance to hospitals about disposition of COVID-19 PUIs and confirmed cases who are unstably housed or returning to homeless shelters and other high-risk settings.</li>
	<li>Describes resources available to hospital discharge planners and the process for referring to CDPH Quarantine/Isolation (Q/I) facilities <strong>starting</strong> <strong>8:00AM on March 23, 2020</strong>.</li>
	<li>Reinforces independence of hospitals to discharge high-risk patients as long as it has been at least 7 days from symptom onset or at least 72 hours after recovery, whichever is longer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Background:</strong> In general, COVID-19 patients can be safely discharged without precautions or Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) notification if it has been at least 7 days from symptom onset or at least 72 hours after recovery, whichever is longer. Recovery is defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath). Lingering cough (as determined by the treating physician) should not prevent a case from being released from isolation. Disposition for certain high-risk populations may require additional resources.</p>

<p><strong>When should CDPH be notified of hospital discharge?</strong><br />
Hospitals seeking to discharge lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients or COVID-19 PUIs prior to completion of the recommended isolation period, should consider the following factors to determine whether the patient could remain in the hospital until the end of their isolation period of if the patient qualifies for transfer to an isolation facility. Examples include:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A high-risk home setting (e.g. there are elderly or immunocompromised family members at home from whom the patient cannot remain isolated).</li>
	<li>The individual is homeless or unstably housed.</li>
</ol>

<p>When evaluating a PUI who is homeless, remember to use the &ldquo;homelessness&rdquo; ICD-10 code (Z59.0) so the information can be captured by state syndromic surveillance.

* Reinforces independence of hospitals to discharge high-risk patients as long as it has been at least 7 days from symptom onset or at least 72 hours after recovery, whichever is longer.

**Background:** In general, COVID-19 patients can be safely discharged without precautions or Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) notification if it has been at least 7 days from symptom onset or at least 72 hours after recovery, whichever is longer. Recovery is defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, shortness of breath). Lingering cough (as determined by the treating physician) should not prevent a case from being released from isolation. Disposition for certain high-risk populations may require additional resources.

**When should CDPH be notified of hospital discharge?**   

Hospitals seeking to discharge lab-confirmed COVID-19 patients or COVID-19 PUIs prior to completion of the recommended isolation period, should consider the following factors to determine whether the patient could remain in the hospital until the end of their isolation period of if the patient qualifies for transfer to an isolation facility. Examples include:

1. A high-risk home setting (e.g. there are elderly or immunocompromised family members at home from whom the patient cannot remain isolated).
2. The individual is homeless or unstably housed.

When evaluating a PUI who is homeless, remember to use the ""homelessness"" ICD-10 code (Z59.0) so the information can be captured by state syndromic surveillance. The facility appointed COVID liaison should compete the [Q/I Facility Intake Form](https://www.chicagohan.org/documents/14171/239678/QI+Facility+Intake+Form_032420.pdf/c91cc536-57ad-d398-c010-def0157fd608?t=1585078641646) prior to calling the CDPH Emergency Operations Center (EOC) Liaison to inform decision-making (see page 2 for additional referral process details).

* Facilities should review [interim guidance for healthcare facilities to prepare for community transmission of COVID-19 in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcare-facilities/guidance-hcf.html) and develop internal policies and plans accordingly. **Plan now to be prepared.**

Suspect PUIs should be immediately placed in airborne isolation and reported to CDPH by calling **312-746-SICK (7425) Monday--Friday during business hours and 311 after hours, weekends, or holidays (312-744-5000 if outside the city).** See [www.chicagohan.org/COVID-19](http://www.chicagohan.org/COVID-19) for additional details.

**General Updates:**

* A presumptive positive patient was identified on 2/29/2020 in Cook County. See news release [here](http://dph.illinois.gov/news/state-illinois-public-health-officials-announce-new-presumptive-positive-covid-19-case-illinois).
* Based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)[guidance](https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2020/HAN00428.asp), CDPH and IDPH have provided information on identifying and evaluating PUIs.
* [New travel notices](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.htm) are in effect to guide triage questions related to suspect PUIs.
  * As of 3/1/2020, ask about travel to China, Iran, Italy, Japan, \& South Korea within the past 14 days.

**Key Questions:**

Does the third presumptive case of COVID-19 in Illinois mean community transmission is happening?

* We do not yet know whether this is evidence of community transmission but will continue to provide updates as soon as available. Hospitals and healthcare providers need to be prepared for a new response phase if this occurs. Upcoming CDC guidance is intended to define phases of geographic spread (similar to influenza), which will be incorporated into response phase guidance.

What is CDPH doing to gather more data on community transmission?

* CDPH, in collaboration with IDPH, will begin sentinel surveillance at several Chicago hospitals on 3/2/2020.
  * Currently, sentinel surveillance will involve performing COVID-19 testing on a number of respiratory specimens from participating hospitals if influenza testing on these specimens is negative.
* CDPH asks providers to consider those with severe, unexplained pneumonia as a PUI and obtain specimens for testing.
  * For any patient with a possible diagnosis of COVID-19, [appropriate PPE](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html) should be used at all times, particularly for aerosol-generating procedures such as intubation or bronchoscopy.
* Consider sending specimens to IDPH laboratory for influenza-like illness outbreaks in long-term care facilities (LTCF).

How should healthcare systems prepare?

* If community transmission is occurring, the goals of the next phase of response will prioritize 1) decreasing morbidity and mortality, 2) decreasing disease transmission, 3) protecting healthcare personnel, 4) maintaining overall system function
* Healthcare facilities should follow these [next steps](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcare-facilities/guidance-hcf.html) to prepare. Find specific LTCF guidance [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcare-facilities/prevent-spread-in-long-term-care-facilities.html).
* Review actions to take now from [CDC interim guidance to prepare for community transmission in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcare-facilities/guidance-hcf.html) including educating staff about transmission, exploring alternatives to face-to-face triage, optimizing use of PPE, and preparing to triage and manage patients with respiratory illness.

How can healthcare systems manage returning international traveler healthcare employees and staff?

* Healthcare systems should consider implementing the following actions:
  * No further business-related travel for employees to China (including Hong Kong and Macau), Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea, with additions if CDC extends travel warnings (level 2 or level 3) to other areas. Informing employees of the need to use PTO, sick time, or vacation days for the period of work restriction might be beneficial for planning purposes
  * No further business-related visitors from CDC-defined areas with travel warnings.
  * Avoid nonessential personal travel for employees to areas with travel warning.
  * Implement occupational health symptom monitoring for healthcare personnel returning from countries with travel level 2 or 3 warnings.
  * Work restrictions, including limitation of direct patient care, can be considered on a continuum for those employees returning from areas with travel level 2 and 3 warnings or those areas with at least ""sustained community transmission"".
    * Considerations leading to full work restriction could include:
      * Patient care duties involving immunocompromised or otherwise high-risk individuals
      * High-risk exposures to sick individuals or healthcare settings while abroad

**Summary:**

The criteria are intended to serve as guidance for evaluation. Patients should be evaluated and discussed with public health departments on a case-by-case basis if their clinical presentation or exposure history is equivocal (e.g., uncertain travel or exposure).</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Recommendations for Reporting, Testing, and Specimen Collection</strong></p>

<p>Healthcare providers should&nbsp;<strong>immediately</strong>&nbsp;notify both infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their local or state health department in the event of a PUI for 2019-nCoV. State health departments that have identified a PUI should immediately contact CDC&rsquo;s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 and complete a 2019-nCoV PUI case investigation form available at&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/novel-coronavirus-2019/downloads/pui-form.pdf"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/novel-coronavirus-2019/downloads/pui-form.pdf</a>. CDC&rsquo;s EOC will assist local/state health departments to collect, store, and ship specimens appropriately to CDC, including during afterhours or on weekends/holidays. At this time, diagnostic testing for 2019-nCoV can be conducted only at CDC. Testing for other respiratory pathogens should not delay specimen shipping to CDC. If a PUI tests positive for another respiratory pathogen, after clinical evaluation and consultation with public health authorities, they may no longer be considered a PUI. This may evolve as more information becomes available on possible 2019 nCoV co-infections.</p>

<p><strong>For biosafety reasons, it is not recommended to perform virus isolation in cell culture or initial characterization of viral agents recovered in cultures of specimens from a PUI for 2019-nCoV.</strong>&nbsp;To increase the likelihood of detecting 2019-nCoV infection, CDC recommends collecting and testing multiple clinical specimens from different sites, including all three specimen types&mdash;lower respiratory, upper respiratory, and serum specimens. Additional specimen types (e.g., stool, urine) may be collected and stored. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a PUI is identified regardless of time of symptom onset. Additional guidance for collection, handling, and testing of clinical specimens is available at&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients Under Investigation for 2019-nCoV</strong></p>

<p>Although the transmission dynamics have yet to be determined, CDC currently recommends a cautious approach to patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV (<a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/clinical-criteria.html"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/clinical-criteria.html</a>).&nbsp;Such patients should be asked to wear a surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be evaluated in a private room with the door closed, ideally an airborne infection isolation room if available. Healthcare personnel entering the room should use standard precautions, contact precautions, airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield). Immediately notify your healthcare facility&rsquo;s infection control personnel and local health department.</p>

</ul>

<p><u>Notes</u></p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Fever may not be present in some patients, such as those who are very young, elderly, immunosuppressed, or taking certain fever-lowering medications. Clinical judgment should be used to guide testing of patients in such situations.</p>

<p><sup>2</sup>Close contact with a person who is under investigation for 2019-nCOV.</p>

<p>Close contact is defined as&mdash;</p>

<p>a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters), or within the room or care area, of a novel coronavirus case for a prolonged period of time while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g., gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection); close contact can include caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with a novel coronavirus case.</p>

<p><em>&ndash; or &ndash;</em></p>

<p>b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a novel coronavirus case (e.g., being coughed on) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment.<br />
Note: travelers from Wuhan coming through designated airports will be given information cards in Mandarin and English describing symptoms to be aware of and will be advised to bring the information card if they do seek medical care.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>Providers should notify infection control personnel and local and state health departments immediately if any patients meet these criteria.&nbsp;Contact Dr. Stephanie Black (<a href=""tel:312-746-6034"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">312-746-6034</a>) for suspect cases or 311 after business hours</strong></em>.&nbsp;</p>","**Recommendations for Healthcare Providers**

Limited information is available to characterize the spectrum of clinical illness associated with 2019-nCoV. No vaccine or specific treatment for 2019-nCoV infection is available; care is supportive.

The CDC clinical criteria for a 2019-nCoV patient under investigation (PUI) have been developed based on what is known about MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and are subject to change as additional information becomes available.

--and in the last 14 days before symptom onset,

· History of travel from Wuhan City, China

-or-

· Close contact^2^ with a person who is under investigation for 2019-nCOV while that person was ill.

2. Fever^1^ OR symptoms of lower respiratory illness (e.g., cough, shortness of breath)

*--*and in the last 14 days before symptom onset,

· Close contact[^2^](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/interim-guidance.html#foot3) with an ill laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV patient.

The above criteria are also available at <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/novel-coronavirus-2019/clinical-criteria.html>. The criteria are intended to serve as guidance for evaluation. Patients should be evaluated and discussed with public health departments on a case-by-case basis if their clinical presentation or exposure history is equivocal (e.g., uncertain travel or exposure).

**Recommendations for Reporting, Testing, and Specimen Collection**

Healthcare providers should **immediately** notify both infection control personnel at their healthcare facility and their local or state health department in the event of a PUI for 2019-nCoV. State health departments that have identified a PUI should immediately contact CDC's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 770-488-7100 and complete a 2019-nCoV PUI case investigation form available at <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/novel-coronavirus-2019/downloads/pui-form.pdf>. CDC's EOC will assist local/state health departments to collect, store, and ship specimens appropriately to CDC, including during afterhours or on weekends/holidays. At this time, diagnostic testing for 2019-nCoV can be conducted only at CDC. Testing for other respiratory pathogens should not delay specimen shipping to CDC. If a PUI tests positive for another respiratory pathogen, after clinical evaluation and consultation with public health authorities, they may no longer be considered a PUI. This may evolve as more information becomes available on possible 2019 nCoV co-infections.

**For biosafety reasons, it is not recommended to perform virus isolation in cell culture or initial characterization of viral agents recovered in cultures of specimens from a PUI for 2019-nCoV.** To increase the likelihood of detecting 2019-nCoV infection, CDC recommends collecting and testing multiple clinical specimens from different sites, including all three specimen types---lower respiratory, upper respiratory, and serum specimens. Additional specimen types (e.g., stool, urine) may be collected and stored. Specimens should be collected as soon as possible once a PUI is identified regardless of time of symptom onset. Additional guidance for collection, handling, and testing of clinical specimens is available at <https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/>.

**Interim Healthcare Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Patients Under Investigation for 2019-nCoV**

Although the transmission dynamics have yet to be determined, CDC currently recommends a cautious approach to patients under investigation for 2019-nCoV (<https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/clinical-criteria.html>). Such patients should be asked to wear a surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be evaluated in a private room with the door closed, ideally an airborne infection isolation room if available. Healthcare personnel entering the room should use standard precautions, contact precautions, airborne precautions, and use eye protection (e.g., goggles or a face shield). Immediately notify your healthcare facility's infection control personnel and local health department.

**Additional Infection Control Practices Resources**

* Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings ([https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html)](https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/isolation/index.html)

++Notes++

^1^Fever may not be present in some patients, such as those who are very young, elderly, immunosuppressed, or taking certain fever-lowering medications. Clinical judgment should be used to guide testing of patients in such situations.

^2^Close contact with a person who is under investigation for 2019-nCOV.

Close contact is defined as---

a) being within approximately 6 feet (2 meters), or within the room or care area, of a novel coronavirus case for a prolonged period of time while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment or PPE (e.g., gowns, gloves, NIOSH-certified disposable N95 respirator, eye protection); close contact can include caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a healthcare waiting area or room with a novel coronavirus case.

*-- or --*

b) having direct contact with infectious secretions of a novel coronavirus case (e.g., being coughed on) while not wearing recommended personal protective equipment.  

Note: travelers from Wuhan coming through designated airports will be given information cards in Mandarin and English describing symptoms to be aware of and will be advised to bring the information card if they do seek medical care.

***Providers should notify infection control personnel and local and state health departments immediately if any patients meet these criteria. Contact Dr. Stephanie Black ([312-746-6034](tel:312-746-6034)) for suspect cases or 311 after business hours***.",True,

<p><span style=""font-size:14px"">The attached CDC HAN Advisory informs state and local health departments and health care providers about an outbreak of Pneumonia of Unknown Etiology (PUE) in Wuhan, China and requests that health care providers ask patients with severe respiratory disease about travel history to Wuhan City. Wuhan City is a major transportation hub about 700 miles south of Beijing with a population of more than 11 million people.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a report from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, as of January 5, 2020, the national authorities in China have reported 59 patients with PUE to WHO. The patients had symptom onset dates from December 12 through December 29, 2019. Patients involved in the cluster reportedly have had fever, dyspnea, and bilateral lung infiltrates on chest radiograph. Of the 59 cases, seven are critically ill, and the remaining patients are in stable condition. No deaths have been reported and no health care providers have been reported to be ill. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has not reported human-to-human transmission.&nbsp;&nbsp;Local authorities have reported negative laboratory test results for seasonal influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among patients associated with this cluster. Additional laboratory testing is ongoing to determine the source of the outbreak but zoonotic origin is possible.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:14px""><strong>Recommendations for Health Care Providers</strong><br />
1. Providers should consider pneumonia related to the cluster for patients with severe respiratory symptoms who:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""font-size:14px"">Traveled to Wuhan since December 1, 2019 and had onset of illness within two weeks of returning,&nbsp;</span></li>
	<li><span style=""font-size:14px"">AND who do not have another known diagnosis that would explain their illness.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>

<p><em><span style=""font-size:14px""><strong>Providers should notify infection control personnel and local and state health departments immediately if any patients meet these criteria.&nbsp;Contact Dr. Stephanie Black (<a href=""tel:312-746-6034"" id=""LPlnk339721"" target=""_blank"">312-746-6034</a>) for suspect cases or 311 after business hours.</strong>&nbsp;</span></em></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:14px"">2. Multiple respiratory tract specimens should be collected from persons with infections suspected to be associated with this cluster, including nasopharyngeal, nasal, and throat swabs. Patients with severe respiratory disease also should have lower respiratory tract specimens collected, if possible.

<p><span style=""font-size:14px"">Please read the attached&nbsp;for the entire health alert.</span></p>","**Summary**

The attached CDC HAN Advisory informs state and local health departments and health care providers about an outbreak of Pneumonia of Unknown Etiology (PUE) in Wuhan, China and requests that health care providers ask patients with severe respiratory disease about travel history to Wuhan City. Wuhan City is a major transportation hub about 700 miles south of Beijing with a population of more than 11 million people. According to a report from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, as of January 5, 2020, the national authorities in China have reported 59 patients with PUE to WHO. The patients had symptom onset dates from December 12 through December 29, 2019. Patients involved in the cluster reportedly have had fever, dyspnea, and bilateral lung infiltrates on chest radiograph. Of the 59 cases, seven are critically ill, and the remaining patients are in stable condition. No deaths have been reported and no health care providers have been reported to be ill. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission has not reported human-to-human transmission. Local authorities have reported negative laboratory test results for seasonal influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among patients associated with this cluster. Additional laboratory testing is ongoing to determine the source of the outbreak but zoonotic origin is possible.

**Recommendations for Health Care Providers**   
1. Providers should consider pneumonia related to the cluster for patients with severe respiratory symptoms who:

* Traveled to Wuhan since December 1, 2019 and had onset of illness within two weeks of returning,
* AND who do not have another known diagnosis that would explain their illness.

***Providers should notify infection control personnel and local and state health departments immediately if any patients meet these criteria. Contact Dr. Stephanie Black ([312-746-6034](tel:312-746-6034){#LPlnk339721}) for suspect cases or 311 after business hours.***

2. Multiple respiratory tract specimens should be collected from persons with infections suspected to be associated with this cluster, including nasopharyngeal, nasal, and throat swabs. Patients with severe respiratory disease also should have lower respiratory tract specimens collected, if possible. Consider saving urine, stool, serum, and respiratory pathology specimens if available.

3. Although the etiology and transmissibility have yet to be determined, and to date, no human-to-human transmission has been reported and no health care providers have been reported ill, CDC currently recommends a cautious approach to symptomatic patients with a history of travel to Wuhan City. Such patients should be asked to wear a surgical mask as soon as they are identified and be evaluated in a private room with the door closed. Personnel entering the room to evaluate the patient should use contact precautions and wear an N95 disposable facepiece respirator. For patients admitted for inpatient care, contact and airborne isolation precautions, in addition to standard precautions, are recommended until further information becomes available.

IDPH Health Advisory: EVALI Health Advisory,2019-12-26T17:48:57.000,46659480,Vaping,,Low,IDPH Health Advisory: EVALI Health Advisory,"<p><strong>Summary and Action Items </strong></p>

<p>1.) As of 12/17/2019, a total of 2,506 cases of E-cigarette, vaping associated lung injury (EVALI) have been reported across all 50 states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including 54 deaths. In Illinois, we have had over 200 cases reported since July 2019.</p>

<p>2.) On 12/20/2019, the CDC released two new Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report&rsquo;s (MMWR) providing updated clinical guidance, and two studies were published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Important updated information is provided below</p>

<p><strong>Background </strong></p>

<p>An unprecedented outbreak of EVALI has impacted individuals in the United States, leading to over 2,506 cases nationwide. In Illinois, we have investigated 206 cases, including five deaths. The median age is 22 (range: 13-85), and the majority of cases are male. Nearly all cases have required hospitalization, and roughly 50% of cases have required intensive care management. Further details about the Illinois and national outbreaks can be found at <a href=""http://www.dph.illinois.gov/"" target=""_blank"">IDPH</a>&rsquo;s and <a href=""cdc.gov"" target=""_blank"">CDC</a>&rsquo;s websites, respectively. A recent study shows that this is a new outbreak, rather than a previously unrecognized clinical syndrome (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr1915313?query=featured_home"" target=""_blank"">NEJM Syndromic Paper</a>).</p>

<p>Potential Exposures Current data suggests that Vitamin E acetate (VEA) in THC based e-cigarette, vaping, products has played a significant role in this acute outbreak. Most cases report using THC-based vaping products, and VEA has been found in both THC containing vaping products, as well as clinical lung fluid samples from impacted patients. Further, VEA has not been identified in clinical lung fluid samples from control patients (<a href=""https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1916433?query=featured_home"" target=""_blank"">NEJM BAL paper</a>). While the peak of cases appears to have occurred in September, cases continue to be reported, and the baseline rate is not back to normal. Further, while it appears that VEA is associated with EVALI, there are many different substances and product sources that are being investigated, and there may be more than one cause.</p>

<p>Compared with other EVALI patients, rehospitalized patients and patients who died after hospital discharge were more likely to have one or more chronic conditions, including cardiac disease, chronic pulmonary disease, and diabetes, and to be older. At least one quarter of rehospitalizations and deaths occurred within 2 days after discharge.&nbsp;&nbsp;Updated guidance recommends posthospitalization outpatient follow-up, optimally within 48 hours of discharge, and emphasizes the importance of preparation for hospital discharge and postdischarge care coordination to reduce risk of rehospitalization and death among hospitalized EVALI patients.&nbsp;Incorporating this updated guidance into the management of hospitalized EVALI patients might reduce EVALI-associated morbidity and mortality.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>","Summary and Action Items

To provide information to local health departments and health care facilities regarding temporary visitor restriction policies during times of increased incidence of influenza-like illness in the community.

Background

Influenza activity continues to increase in the United States and has reached regional activity levels in Illinois. Many counties have experienced high levels of influenza-like illness (characterized as fever of 100ºF \[37.8ºC\] or higher plus cough and/or sore throat), increases in influenza-related ICU admissions, long-term care facility outbreaks, and increases in positive laboratory specimens.

IDPH and LHD Response

The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) recommends that health care facilities implement the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) comprehensive influenza prevention and control recommendations, [Prevention Strategies for Seasonal Influenza in Healthcare Settings](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/infectioncontrol/healthcaresettings.htm). During times of increased incidence of influenza-like illness in the community, IDPH supports implementation of temporary visitor restriction policies in health care facilities which may include the following:

• Do not allow visitation by persons less than 18 years of age,

• Limit the number of visitors to two per patient at any one time,

• Promote compliance with Hand Hygiene and [Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/infectioncontrol/resphygiene.htm),

• Assess visitors for symptoms of acute respiratory illness (fever, cough, sore throat),

• Request that visitors with acute respiratory illness symptoms not visit, but if they insist, require a mask be worn, and

• Limit visits to patients in isolation for influenza to persons who are necessary for the patients' emotional well-being and care.

Exemptions to these temporary visitor restrictions are permissible at the discretion of the facility's Infection Prevention and Control departments for circumstances including, but not limited to, end-of-life situations. Lifting visitor restrictions is at the discretion of the health care facility. Facilities should follow the CDC guidelines and those above when making these decisions. Local health departments and facilities should monitor influenza activity in their community and facilities should monitor the level of activity and severity of illness they are experiencing within their facility (ER and urgent care visits, influenza hospitalizations, etc.) to help guide them with these decisions. The weekly Illinois influenza surveillance report is also a useful tool when evaluating activity levels for this purpose.

1) To alert clinicians to recently reported cases of profound methemoglobinemia secondary to Sodium Nitrite Ingestion<br />
2) Provide information on treatment resources and recommendations<br />
Background<br />
In a ten-day period, three patients with extremely elevated methemoglobin levels have been reported to the Illinois Poison Center. Two of the three patients expired. Two of the individuals are suspected intentional ingestions of sodium nitrite by history, and the third case is consistent by clinical presentation with a sodium nitrite ingestion. Concurrently, a spike in suicidal sodium nitrite ingestions is being reported by poison centers in various areas around the country.<br />
Potential Exposures and Transmission<br />
Web sites that refer to suicide recipes have mentioned sodium nitrite ingestion as a successful method of self-harm. The compound can be made at home or purchased in bulk from online retailers such as eBay or Amazon.<br />
Symptoms<br />
Presenting symptoms of the above patients included profound cyanosis, shortness of breath and hypotension. Dizziness, confusion, nausea and vomiting may also be seen. Pulseoximetry readings generally do not improve with increased supplemental oxygen. Venous blood when drawn will have a characteristic &lsquo;chocolate brown&rsquo; color. Methemoglobinemia is suggested when there is clinical cyanosis in the presence of a normal arterial pO2 (PaO2).<br />
Treatment<br />
The antidote for this poisoning is intravenous methylene blue and was successful in the resuscitation of one of the recent cases with a level that would have otherwise likely have been fatal if left untreated.<br />
Recommendations for healthcare facilities<br />
Please contact the Illinois Poison Center at 1-800-222-1222 for treatment recommendations for patients presenting with severe methemoglobinemia, and to report cases for public health monitoring. Further acute clinical guidance from the Illinois Poison Center is attached to this alert.<br />

"CDPH: Testing for Legionella in Adults with Pneumonia, October 2019",2019-10-15T16:31:28.000,46658483,Infectious Disease,,Low,Testing for Legionella in Adults with Pneumonia,"<p><strong>Background:&nbsp; </strong>Legionnaires&rsquo; disease is caused by <em>Legionella</em> bacteria. &nbsp;It is characterized by pneumonia with typical symptoms of fever, cough and myalgia.&nbsp; These symptoms may not be present in all cases, and additional symptoms like shortness of breath, headache, confusion, nausea and diarrhea may be present.&nbsp; Illness presents approximately 2-14 days after exposure to an environmental source. &nbsp;<em>Legionella</em> is a ubiquitous aquatic organism that grows in warm environments (77&deg;&ndash;108&deg;F). &nbsp;Exposure occurs through inhalation of contaminated aerosols from devices such as cooling towers, whirlpool spas, showers, and faucets, and through aspiration of contaminated water. &nbsp;Groups at higher risk include persons &gt; 50 years old, persons with smoking history, and persons with chronic lung disease or immunocompromising conditions. &nbsp;The case-fatality rate is estimated to be 10% for community-acquired &nbsp;and 25% for healthcare-associated Legionnaires&rsquo; disease. &nbsp;Recommended treatment options include macrolide or fluoroquinolone antibiotics (<a href=""https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/44/Supplement_2/S27/372079"">https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/44/Supplement_2/S27/372079</a>).</p>

<p>Legionnaires&rsquo; disease follows a seasonal pattern in Chicago, with an increased number of cases reported from June to October each year. &nbsp;Rates of Legionnaires&rsquo; disease in Chicago are consistently higher than nationally reported rates, and have more than doubled from 2010 (1.2 cases per 100,000 residents) to 2017 (2.9 cases per 100,000 residents) with 2018 marking Chicago&rsquo;s highest reported annual burden to date of 145 confirmed cases.</p>

<p>Providers should test for <em>Legionella </em>when evaluating adults with symptoms of pneumonia. &nbsp;Testing should include concurrent urine antigen testing (UAT) <u>and</u> <em>Legionella </em>sputum/respiratory culture on selective media.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnostic Testing:</strong> Culture of <em>Legionella</em> from lower respiratory secretions or tissues is the gold standard for diagnosis and should be used in conjunction with the <em>Legionella</em> UAT (which is specific for <em>Legionella pneumophila</em>, serogroup 1). &nbsp;Culture has the added benefit of identifying pathogenic non-<em>pneumophila Legionella</em> species. &nbsp;<em>Legionella</em> isolates can be further analyzed using molecular techniques. &nbsp;Molecular comparison of clinical and environmental isolates grown in culture allows the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) and the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) to identify linked clusters of infection as well as potential environmental sources of these infections. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note the following regarding the diagnosis of Legionnaires&rsquo; disease:</p>

<p style=""margin-left:.5in""><strong>&bull; </strong>Best diagnostic practice for both sensitivity and specificity is to obtain both sputum culture of lower respiratory secretions (e.g., sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage) and urinary antigen test <u>concurrently</u>. &nbsp;Sputum should ideally be obtained prior to antibiotic administration, but antibiotic treatment should not be delayed to facilitate this process. &nbsp;Early treatment results in better outcomes.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:.5in""><strong>&bull; </strong>Laboratories sometimes reject lower respiratory specimens during a work-up for pneumonia based on specimen quality (e.g., due to lack of white blood cells in the sample, contamination with other bacteria). &nbsp;However, laboratories should not reject lower respiratory specimens for these reasons when working-up Legionnaires&#39; disease because <em>Legionella</em> can often be recovered.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:1.0in""><strong>&bull; </strong>Sputum produced by patients with Legionnaires&#39; disease may not have many white blood cells.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:1.0in""><strong>&bull; </strong>Contaminating bacteria do not negatively impact isolation of <em>Legionella</em> on selective media (e., Buffered Charcoal</p>

<p style=""margin-left:1.0in"">Yeast Extract [BCYE] agar plus antibiotics).</p>

<p style=""margin-left:.5in""><strong>&bull;</strong> <em>Legionella</em> culture requires the use of specialized media. Please alert your microbiology laboratory that Legionnaires&rsquo; disease is in your differential diagnosis so that the correct testing is performed. &nbsp;The best specimens for culturing <em>Legionella</em> are sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:.5in""><strong>&bull;</strong> Urine antigen testing (UAT) is widely available as a rapid method for detecting <em>L. pneumophila </em>serogroup 1. Although <em>L. pneumophila</em> serogroup 1 accounts for most laboratory confirmed <em>Legionella</em> cases, a negative UAT does not rule-out infection with other species and serotypes.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:.5in"">&bull; Serologic diagnosis is less useful for diagnosing acute infection and requires paired sera, collected 3&ndash;4 weeks apart to detect a fourfold rise in antibody titer to a level &gt; 1:128. <u>A single antibody titer is not diagnostic for Legionnaires&rsquo; disease</u>; convalescent serum must be obtained for comparison.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations for Providers</strong>:</p>

<p>To help CDPH identify clusters of Legionnaires&rsquo; disease:</p>

<p style=""margin-left:45.0pt"">&bull; Maintain a high index of suspicion for Legionnaires&rsquo; disease among all adults with pneumonia, whether community-acquired or nosocomial.</p>

<p>&bull; Specifically request <strong>both</strong> culture and UAT for <em>Legionella </em>diagnosis, and collect appropriate specimens for testing.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:45.0pt"">&bull; Report all Legionnaires&rsquo; disease cases to CDPH via the Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (INEDSS) or by calling the CDPH reporting line at 312-743-9000.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:45.0pt"">&bull; Send all <em>Legionella </em>isolates to the appropriate IDPH Laboratory indicated below for whole genome sequencing. No prior CDPH authorization is required.&nbsp; Send isolates and an IDPH laboratory test requisition form (<a href=""http://www.dph.illinois.gov/sites/default/files/forms/formsohp-labscd-test-requisition.pdf"">http://www.dph.illinois.gov/sites/default/files/forms/formsohp-labscd-test-requisition.pdf</a>) to:</p>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>","**Background:** Legionnaires' disease is caused by *Legionella* bacteria. It is characterized by pneumonia with typical symptoms of fever, cough and myalgia. These symptoms may not be present in all cases, and additional symptoms like shortness of breath, headache, confusion, nausea and diarrhea may be present. Illness presents approximately 2-14 days after exposure to an environmental source. *Legionella* is a ubiquitous aquatic organism that grows in warm environments (77°--108°F). Exposure occurs through inhalation of contaminated aerosols from devices such as cooling towers, whirlpool spas, showers, and faucets, and through aspiration of contaminated water. Groups at higher risk include persons \> 50 years old, persons with smoking history, and persons with chronic lung disease or immunocompromising conditions. The case-fatality rate is estimated to be 10% for community-acquired and 25% for healthcare-associated Legionnaires' disease. Recommended treatment options include macrolide or fluoroquinolone antibiotics (<https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/44/Supplement_2/S27/372079>).

Legionnaires' disease follows a seasonal pattern in Chicago, with an increased number of cases reported from June to October each year. Rates of Legionnaires' disease in Chicago are consistently higher than nationally reported rates, and have more than doubled from 2010 (1.2 cases per 100,000 residents) to 2017 (2.9 cases per 100,000 residents) with 2018 marking Chicago's highest reported annual burden to date of 145 confirmed cases.

Providers should test for *Legionella* when evaluating adults with symptoms of pneumonia. Testing should include concurrent urine antigen testing (UAT) ++and++ *Legionella*sputum/respiratory culture on selective media.

**Diagnostic Testing:** Culture of *Legionella* from lower respiratory secretions or tissues is the gold standard for diagnosis and should be used in conjunction with the *Legionella* UAT (which is specific for *Legionella pneumophila* , serogroup 1). Culture has the added benefit of identifying pathogenic non-*pneumophila Legionella* species. *Legionella* isolates can be further analyzed using molecular techniques. Molecular comparison of clinical and environmental isolates grown in culture allows the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) and the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) to identify linked clusters of infection as well as potential environmental sources of these infections.

Please note the following regarding the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease:

**•** Best diagnostic practice for both sensitivity and specificity is to obtain both sputum culture of lower respiratory secretions (e.g., sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage) and urinary antigen test ++concurrently++. Sputum should ideally be obtained prior to antibiotic administration, but antibiotic treatment should not be delayed to facilitate this process. Early treatment results in better outcomes.

**•** Laboratories sometimes reject lower respiratory specimens during a work-up for pneumonia based on specimen quality (e.g., due to lack of white blood cells in the sample, contamination with other bacteria). However, laboratories should not reject lower respiratory specimens for these reasons when working-up Legionnaires' disease because *Legionella* can often be recovered.

**•**Sputum produced by patients with Legionnaires' disease may not have many white blood cells.

**•** Contaminating bacteria do not negatively impact isolation of *Legionella* on selective media (e., Buffered Charcoal

Yeast Extract \[BCYE\] agar plus antibiotics).

**•** *Legionella* culture requires the use of specialized media. Please alert your microbiology laboratory that Legionnaires' disease is in your differential diagnosis so that the correct testing is performed. The best specimens for culturing *Legionella* are sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

**•** Urine antigen testing (UAT) is widely available as a rapid method for detecting *L. pneumophila* serogroup 1. Although *L. pneumophila* serogroup 1 accounts for most laboratory confirmed *Legionella* cases, a negative UAT does not rule-out infection with other species and serotypes.

• Serologic diagnosis is less useful for diagnosing acute infection and requires paired sera, collected 3--4 weeks apart to detect a fourfold rise in antibody titer to a level \> 1:128. ++A single antibody titer is not diagnostic for Legionnaires' disease++; convalescent serum must be obtained for comparison.

**Recommendations for Providers**:

To help CDPH identify clusters of Legionnaires' disease:

• Maintain a high index of suspicion for Legionnaires' disease among all adults with pneumonia, whether community-acquired or nosocomial.

• Specifically request **both** culture and UAT for *Legionella*diagnosis, and collect appropriate specimens for testing.

• Report all Legionnaires' disease cases to CDPH via the Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (INEDSS) or by calling the CDPH reporting line at 312-743-9000.

• Send all *Legionella* isolates to the appropriate IDPH Laboratory indicated below for whole genome sequencing. No prior CDPH authorization is required. Send isolates and an IDPH laboratory test requisition form (<http://www.dph.illinois.gov/sites/default/files/forms/formsohp-labscd-test-requisition.pdf>) to:

IDPH recommends the following to clinical providers:  

1. All patients with serious respiratory illness of unknown etiology be asked about recent vaping  

2. A urinary toxicology screen (including THC, quantified as necessary) be obtained for these patients if a reliable vaping history is unavailable, or if otherwise clinically indicated  

3. Obtaining a chest radiograph for patients with unexplained respiratory symptoms and vaping exposures presenting to both inpatient and outpatient settings  

4. Ruling out common infections (e.g. with a respiratory viral panel, influenza testing, blood/sputum cultures), and any other clinically-warranted infectious, and non-infectious, etiology, in patients with unexplained respiratory illness and vaping exposures.

**IDPH asks clinical providers to:**   

1. Report patients with unexplained serious respiratory illness and recent vaping to their local health department (LHD) within normal business hours, using the attached preliminary case report form. The case report provides a link to your LHD contact information.  

2. Retain vaping product or devices from case-patients for testing  

3. Hold clinical samples from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and /or lung tissue biopsies after processing and diagnostic evaluation for potential submission to the IDPH laboratory.

IDPH is requesting any remaining vaping product or devices be retained for testing.

<p><span style=""font-size:14px"">See attached document for the full details.</span></p>","**Summary**

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is providing: 1) background information on the forms of e-cigarette products, 2) information on the multistate outbreak of severe pulmonary disease associated with using e-cigarette products (devices, liquids, refill pods, and cartridges), and 3) clinical features of patients with severe pulmonary disease.

**Recommendations for Clinicians**   
1. Report cases of severe pulmonary disease of unclear etiology and a history of e-cigarette product use within the past 90 days to your state or local health department.  
2. Ask all patients who report e-cigarette product use within the last 90 days about signs and symptoms of pulmonary illness.  
3. If e-cigarette product use is suspected as a possible etiology of a patient's severe pulmonary disease, obtain detailed history regarding:

• Substance(s) used: nicotine, cannabinoids (e.g., marijuana, THC, THC concentrates, CBD, CBD oil, synthetic cannabinoids \[e.g., K2 or spice\], hash oil, Dank vapes), flavors, or other substances  
• Substance source(s): commercially available liquids (i.e., bottles, cartridges, or pods), homemade liquids, and re-use of old cartridges or pods with homemade or commercially bought liquids  
• Device(s) used: manufacturer; brand name; product name; model; serial number of the product, device, or e-liquid; if the device can be customized by the user; and any product modifications by the user (e.g., exposure of the atomizer or heating coil)  
• Where the product(s) were purchased  
• Method of substance use: aerosolization, dabbing, or dripping   
• Other potential cases: sharing e-cigarette products (devices, liquids, refill pods, or cartridges) with others

4. Determine if any remaining product, including devices and liquids, are available for testing. Testing can be coordinated with the local or state health departments.  
5. Consider all possible causes of illness in patients reporting respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms and of e-cigarette product use. Evaluate and treat for other possible causes of illness (e.g., infectious, rheumatologic, neoplastic) as clinically indicated. Consider consultation with specialists (pulmonary, infectious disease, critical care, medical toxicology) as appropriate.  
6. Clinical improvement of patients with severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use has been reported with the use of corticosteroids. The decision to use corticosteroids should be made on a case-by-case basis based on risks and benefits and the likelihood of other etiologies.   
7. Lipoid pneumonia associated with inhalation of lipids in aerosols generated by e-cigarettes has been reported based on the detection of lipid-laden alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lipid staining (e.g., oil red O). The decision about whether to perform a BAL should be based on individual clinical circumstances.  
8. Lung biopsies have been performed on some patients. If a lung biopsy is obtained, lipid staining may be considered during pathologic examination, and is best performed on fresh tissue. Routine pathology tissue processing (including formalin-fixation and paraffin-embedding) can remove lipids. Conducting routine tissue processing and histopathologic evaluation is still important. Consider consultation with specialists in pulmonary medicine and pathology to help inform any evaluation plan.   
9. Patients who have received treatment for severe pulmonary disease related to e-cigarette product use should undergo follow-up evaluation as clinically indicated to monitor pulmonary function.

3. In patients with unexplained serious respiratory illness and vaping exposures, IDPH recommends ruling out common infectious and non-infectious etiologies.<br />
4. If possible, take a detailed history of the frequency of vaping and the products used, and document these in the medical notes.<br />
5. If the patient has products they have vaped, ask them not to use them again and save them in case product testing is requested.<br />
6. IDPH is asking for any clinical samples from bronco-alveolar lavage (BAL) and /or tissue biopsies be saved, and if possible, sent to the IDPH laboratory.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:14px""><strong>Background</strong>: Many states are reporting cases of severe respiratory illness among individuals who have arecent history of vaping (use of e-cigarette and similar devices to inhale aerosolized liquid).<br />
As of August 19, 2019, 10 Illinois residents are considered cases and others are under investigation. Most cases are in Chicago and the collar counties. The age range of the patients is from 15 to 27 years, and 77% are male.<br />

Reminder: Info Regarding Congenital Syphilis Prevent. via Proper Treatment of Preg. Females w/Syp.,2019-08-13T13:41:49.000,46657982,STI,,Low,Information Regarding Congenital Syphilis Prevention via Proper Treatment of Pregnant Females w/ Syphilis,"<p>Key Messages and Action Steps<br />
&bull; Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#39;s (CDC) 2015 Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) Treatment<br />
Guidelines:<br />
o Benzathine Penicillin G (Bicillin L-A&reg;) is the only known effective antimicrobial for preventing maternal<br />
transmission to the fetus and treating fetal infection;<br />
o No proven alternatives to penicillin are available for treatment of syphilis during pregnancy; and<br />
o Pregnant women who have a history of penicillin allergy should be desensitized and treated with penicillin. Skin<br />
testing or oral graded penicillin dose challenge might be helpful in identifying women at risk for acute allergic<br />
reactions.<br />
Contact Information: If you have questions or would like additional information regarding syphilis, please contact Chicago Department of Public Health, HIV/STI Bureau, Irina Tabidze, MD, MPH at <a href=""mailto:irina.tabidze@cityofchicago.org"">irina.tabidze@cityofchicago.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, there has been a sharp increase in the number of babies born with syphilis in the United States. After a steady decline from 2008 to 2012, data from 2013 to 2017 show a 154% increase in congenital syphilis (CS) cases. In 2017, the number of probable and confirmed CS cases was 918, the highest number since 1997 (<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2018/std-surveillance-report-2017-press-release.html"" target=""_blank"">https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2018/std-surveillance-report-2017-press-release.html</a>).</p>

If patients with fever report travel to DRC in the preceding 21 days, remember that the risk of Ebola remains **low** but please do the following:

* ask *exactly*where they traveled in DRC (which cities, which areas)
* ask about contact with anyone who was ill in DRC
* screen for headache, body aches, sore throat, diarrhea, weakness, vomiting, stomach pain, rash, or red eyes
* call the CDPH reportable disease hotline at 312-743-9000 during busness hours, or after-hours or on weekends call 311 and ask for the communicable disease physician on-call.

An ongoing study found that water meter installation was associated with increased water lead levels in some Chicago homes, and 7.1% of homes had lead levels above EPA guidelines for drinking water. Chicago's Department of Water Management has paused installation of water meters while investigating the cause, and your patients may have questions.  
**Lead-based paint and lead dust remain the overwhelming causes of elevated blood lead levels in Chicago children.**  
Children under age 6 and pregnant or breastfeeding women are at highest risk of lead poisoning.  
Recommendations for healthcare providers:

* **Test ALL Chicago children for lead at 12, 24, and 36 months of age as part of routine well-child care.**
* Educate parents about lead poisoning, especially lead-based paint and dust.

Recommendations for parents:

* ++Water testing:++ Call 311 or visit [http://www.chicagowaterquality.org](http://www.chicagowaterquality.org/home) to order a free water lead test kit or schedule an appointment for testing.
* ++Use only cold water for drinking, cooking, and making baby formula++. Hot water can dissolve lead more quickly.
* ++Filter use++: If your home has children under age 6, pregnant or breastfeeding women, or women who may become pregrant, you can use a filter certified by NSF to remove lead under Standard 53. Chicago homes with water meters can receive free water filters from the City.
* ++Flushing++: If water has been unused for 6 hours or more, run your water for at least 5 minutes before using tap water for drinking or cooking. Taking a shower, laundry, and washing dishes all count as running your water.
* ++Clean your aerator++: Regularly (at least once per month) clean your faucet's aerator or screen.

* On June 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that it is expecting a 3 to 10 month nationwide shortage of APLISOL®tuberculin skin tests (TSTs), a product of Par Pharmaceuticals.
* During this time it is recommended that health care facilities:
  * Substitute interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) blood tests for TSTs and/or substitute TUBERSOL® for APLISOL® for skin testing.
  * Prioritize TSTs for persons who are considered at risk of TB, which might require delayed testing for individuals with a lower-risk. High-risk groups for TB infection include:
    * People who are recent contacts exposed to persons with TB disease;
    * People born in or who frequently travel to countries where TB disease is common;
    * People who currently or used to live in large group settings, such as homeless shelters or correctional facilities;
    * People with weaker immune systems, such as those with certain health conditions or taking certain medications that may alter immunity; and
    * Children, especially those under age 5, if they are in one of the risk groups noted above.

**Webinar Description**

Rates of sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) such as chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and gonorrhea (GC) have reached an all-time high. In the U.S., California leads the nation in reported cases of these STDs.

Because persons with CT and GC are often asymptomatic, screening is essential for the early detection and treatment that can prevent reproductive complications including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain in females and epididymitis in males.

Join us for a webinar to learn about current clinical guidelines for routine and targeted screening, treatment, follow-up, and prevention of CT and GC.

After the webinar, providers will be able to:

· Understand current guidelines for screening for CT and GC among sexually active women and men

· List the indications for anorectal and oropharyngeal CT/GC screening

· Explain when test-of-cure is indicated

· Identify the proper ICD-10 codes for lab requests and billing information",True,

Implicated food items were no longer available at the store as of Mar 1, 2019 and there was no evidence that food made after this date was contaminated.

* **Perform stool culture for symptomatic (diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps) patients who consumed foods purchased at the Supermercado Rivera grocery store (4334 W. 51st St., Chicago, IL, 60632), or for patients with febrile diarrheal symptoms, even if they report no exposure to the establishment.**
* **Report any confirmed cases of salmonellosis promptly to the Chicago Department of Public Health Communicable Disease Program at 312-743-9000 during normal business hours (M-F, 8:30 AM - 4:30 PM). If an exposure to the establishment is identified outside of regular business hours, dial 3-1-1 to report to the communicable disease physician on call.**

**Backgound**: As of March 6, 2019, CDPH has identified 5 confirmed cases of salmonellosis who reported eating carnitas or other foods purchased on February 23, 2019 or February 24, 2019 from the Supermercado Rivera deli counter (4334 W. 51st St., Chicago, IL, 60632). Several other reports of clinically compatible illness among those eating foods from the grocery store on the same two dates have also been received, though not yet confirmed by laboratory testing. Four cases have tested positive for Salmonella serogroup Infantis with matching PFGE pattern; the serogroup results for one confirmed case are pending. Symptom onset dates range from February 23, 2019 to February 26, 2019; we expect more cases to present for medical care. On 3/1/19, CDPH performed an environmental assessment of the grocery store and provided guidance on safe food handling practices and environmental cleaning to prevent further spread of disease. Implicated food items were no longer available at the store as of Mar 1, 2019 and there was no evidence that food made after this date was contaminated. CDPH is monitoring closely for additional reports of illness. It is critical that healthcare providers test patients with symptoms consistent with salmonellosis and promptly report positive results to the health department.  
**Symptoms:** Salmonellosis symptoms include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps, which usually present between 12 and 72 hours after exposure. Diarrhea onset is often sudden, and nausea and vomiting may accompany illness. Symptoms typically resolve within four to seven days but can occasionally last longer. Although most cases are self-resolving, treatment may be indiciated in the elderly, infants, and those with impaired immune systems who are at increased risk of invasive disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that Salmonella causes approximately one million illnesses and 450 deaths in the United States each year.  
**Laboratory evaluation and treatment** : Patients presenting with diarrhea and a compatible illness should have a stool culture for Salmonella. For 2 cases in which susceptibility report was available, the strain was susceptible to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Treatment guidelines for Salmonella may be found at <https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/general/technical.html>. Salmonella isolates should be sent to the Illinois Department of Public Health laboratories. Stool cultures are critical to confirm the organism and to complete pulsed field gel electrophoresis testing, which is necessary to link outbreak cases together.  
**Reporting**: Salmonella infections are reportable to the Chicago Department of Public Health. To report a suspected or confirmed Salmonella infection or for questions regarding communicable disease reporting, call the CDPH reporting line at 312-743-9000 during normal business hours (M-F, 8:30 AM - 4:30 PM).

**Summary and Action Items**

1. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are warning patients and providers about the risks of procedures involving unproven and unapproved stem cell therapies.
2. Currently, the only stem cell treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are products that treat certain cancers and disorders of the blood and immune system. If the products are being used for arthritis, injury-related pain, chronic joint pain, anti-aging or other health issues, they are not approved by FDA unless they are part of a study under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND).
3. As a result of bacterial infections in patients following the use of stem cell products from the ReGen Series® (distributed by Liveyon, LLC), an FDA investigation into the manufacturer, Genetech, revealed inappropriate screening of stem cell donors for diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus.
4. The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) is unaware of bacterial infections occurring in Illinois residents following the use of cells from the ReGen Series®; however, patients who received these cells since 2017 are advised to discuss evaluation for HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and possibly other blood-borne infections with their healthcare providers (see diagnosis section below).
5. The Chicago Department of Public Health will be notifying known Chicago clinics that used the ReGen Series®. These clinics will be asked to notify patients that received these products from 2017 to the present. Patients will be advised to speak with a health care provider regarding the need for testing for HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus and, in some circumstances, other pathogens (see diagnosis section above). If patients do not have a health care provider or are unable to afford testing, they should contact Chicago Department of Public Health:

**SUMMARY AND ACTION ITEMS**

* **Due to increased local activity in a cluster of childcare facilities, CDPH is strengthening post- exposure prophylaxis and vaccination recommendations for all families reporting exposure to pertussis in these settings.**
* **Healthcare providers may see an increase in the number of patients seeking evaluation, testing, prophylaxis, or treatment for pertussis due to ongoing exposures and outbreaks at Chicago area childcare centers located in Lincoln Park, Lakeview, North Center, Albany Park, Irving Park, and Logan Square.**
* **Providers should ask about recent exposure in patients presenting with cough for over 14 days. Pertussis vaccination history should not alter plans to test or prescribe post-exposure prophylaxis.**

**Background**  
From October 1, 2018 to February 25, 2019, Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) received reports of 62 pediatric pertussis cases; 22 (35%) under 12 months old; 30 (48%) involved 14 daycares. This increased from 26 pediatric cases during the same time period last year in which 7 (27%) were under 12 months old and 2 (8%) involved 2 daycares. The childcare settings are mostly clustered on the north side of the city necessitating management of a significant number of exposures to prevent a larger outbreak. In periods of baseline pertussis activity, public health recommendations in group settings can vary depending on the number of cases identified, age of index case, and duration of cough. Persons with pertussis are infectious from the beginning of the catarrhal stage (runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever) through the third week after the onset of paroxysms (multiple, rapid coughs) or until 5 days after the start of effective antimicrobial treatment.  
**Outbreak Guidance to Prevent Further Pertussis Transmission:**  
In isolated childcare outbreaks of 5 or more cases (lower threshold if infant cases), CDPH recommends exposed children seek medical evaluation to receive either prophylaxis (if asymptomatic) or testing with treatment/prophylaxis (if symptomatic) and return to the childcare facility ONLY when treatment is completed or prophylaxis is initiated.  

* **Due to increased local activity in a cluster of childcare facilities, CDPH is expanding the above recommendation to children with exposure to \> 1 pertussis case in a daycare setting.**

Families and employees may present with letters from certain childcare facilities and these facilities are being instructed to reserve the right to exclude children or staff if they refuse evaluation/management and then become symptomatic. Families will be asked to provide some evidence of either phone/in-office triage by a healthcare provider in the form of an antibiotic prescription, after-visit summary, or note. Factors to consider when determining if phone triage is appropriate include age of the patient exposed, underlying medical conditions, and provider relationship with family.

2.) Healthcare providers without evidence of measles immunity should be offered 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine  
3.) Healthcare facilities should have readily available lists of immunity status of all health care personnel  
**Background:**  
Ongoing measles outbreaks nationwide, including recently confirmed cases in Illinois, provides an opportunity to remind health care facilities and providers of the recommendation that all health care personnel\* (HCP) have evidence of immunity to measles.  
HCP are at higher risk than the general adult population for becoming infected with measles. If a measles exposure occurs in a facility, it can be costly, and can lead to a substantial disruption of hospital routines, especially if the immunity of staff is unknown. If a measles exposure occurs in a facility, non-immune exposed HCPs are required to be excluded from work from the 5th - 21st day after exposure.  
For these and other reasons, ACIP guidelines recommend that all HCP should have presumptive evidence of immunity to measles. Further, facilities should have this documented and readily available.  
For HCPs, presumptive evidence of immunity to measles for persons includes any of the following:  
• written documentation of vaccination with 2 doses of live measles or MMR vaccine administered at least 28 days apart  
• laboratory evidence of immunity (eg- positive measles serum IgG)  
• laboratory confirmation of disease, or  
• birth before 1957\*\*  
*\*\*For unvaccinated personnel born before 1957 who lack laboratory evidence of measles immunity, health-care facilities should recommend 2 doses of MMR vaccine during an outbreak of measles*  
For HCPs without presumptive evidence of immunity, pre-vaccination antibody screening before MMR vaccination is not necessary, unless the medical facility considers it cost effective. Serologic testing for immunity is not recommended for HCP who have 2 documented doses of MMR vaccine.

If specimens are being referred to IDPH laboratories which have shown parasitic infection through microscopic observation in the original testing facility and PCR analysis at IDPH is unable to confirm malaria infection, blood can be referred to CDC for supplemental testing to rule-out Babesia.  
When submitting specimens, please include any microscopic observation results including semi-quantitation information (such as a low-level of parasitemia), on page two in the ""Other Pertinent Information"" area of the Communicable Diseases Laboratory Test Requisition form. Please see attached updated Instructions for Malaria Specimen Submission.  
If you have any questions about these changes, please do not hesitate to contact our Springfield Laboratory at 217-782-6562.

2. Label the specimen tube with the patient's full name and date of birth.  
3. Complete all information on the Communicable Diseases test requisition. Preliminary microscopic observations including semi-quantitation, such as low-level of parasitemia, etc., should be included on page two in the ""Other Pertinent Information"" section of the Communicable Diseases Laboratory Test Requisition form.  
5. Messenger/Courier by ground transport: Wrap specimen in absorbent material. Place wrapped specimen into a biohazard labeled bag and seal securely. Place the test requisition on the outside of the biohazard labeled bag. Place the sealed biohazard bag and test requisition inside the shipping container. The shipping container must be rigid such as a cooler and labeled with the UN 3373 Biological Substance Category B marking. Close securely.  
6. Commercial carrier by ground/air transport: Place the specimen inside a biohazard labeled 95 kPa bag and add sufficient absorbent material to absorb the entire contents. Seal following the instructions on the bag. Place the test requisition(s) in the 95 kPa bag outside pouch and seal following the instructions on the bag. Place the sealed 95 kPa bag and completed test requisition(s) inside the shipping container and close securely.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is providing information on: 1) the current status of a multistate outbreak of coagulopathy from exposure to synthetic cannabinoid products containing a vitamin K-epoxide cycle antagonist, brodifacoum; 2) the emergence of 2 new clinical scenarios; and 3) recommendations to help clinicians make decisions related to these 2 new clinical scenarios.

This is an update to the Health Alert Network (HAN) advisory released on May 25, 2018 titled *Outbreak of* *Life-threatening Coagulopathy Associated with Synthetic Cannabinoids Use*(<https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/han00410.asp>).

**Outbreak Update**   
Since the index patient with hypocoagulopathy associated with synthetic cannabinoids use was identified on March 8, 2018 in Illinois, at least 324 people have presented to healthcare facilities with serious bleeding from possible exposure. The largest number of patients were in Illinois (164), followed by Wisconsin (86), Maryland (44), Florida (6), Pennsylvania (6), Missouri (5), North Carolina (5), Indiana (5), Kentucky (1), Virginia (1), and West Virginia (1). Laboratory investigation confirmed brodifacoum exposure in at least 150 patients. There have been at least eight (8) fatalities. Vitamin K1 continues to be the recommended therapy. Since the original HAN advisory on May 25, 2018, two (2) new clinical scenarios have emerged:

1. Several patients have outpatient follow-up blood brodifacoum concentrations that are higher than their initial blood brodifacoum concentrations.
2. At least one patient has become pregnant since starting outpatient oral Vitamin K1 treatment.

When patients are found to have outpatient follow-up blood brodifacoum concentrations higher than their initial blood brodifacoum concentrations, it strongly suggests that they have continued or resumed using synthetic cannabinoid products containing brodifacoum while on oral vitamin K1 therapy. The consequences of re-exposure to brodifacoum include:

1. Risk of life-threatening hemorrhage,
2. Oral vitamin K1 dosing may need to be increased, and
3. Oral vitamin K1 treatment duration may need to be extended.

Pregnancies in patients who are on oral vitamin K1 treatment for brodifacoum toxicity are high-risk pregnancies. Brodifacoum crosses the placenta. Both mother and fetus are at risk for serious bleeding. Brodifacoum may also be a teratogen because its chemical structure is similar to warfarin, a known teratogen.

**Recommendations for Clinicians**

1. Maintain a high index of suspicion for continued or resumed use of synthetic cannabinoid products containing brodifacoum in patients who are on oral vitamin K1 therapy. Ask these patients about continued or resumed use of synthetic cannabinoid products.

2. Counsel against resuming or continuing use of synthetic cannabinoid products. Refer patients to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) national helpline, 1-800-662-HELP(4357), a free, confidential, 24/7, 365-day-a-year treatment referral and information service in English and Spanish for individuals and families facing mental and/or substance use disorders; substance abuse counseling is also available.

3. Advise patients that their current oral vitamin K1 dosing may not prevent recurrent coagulopathy from re-exposure to brodifacoum in synthetic cannabinoid products and the duration of oral vitamin K1 treatment may need to be extended.

4. Consider periodic quantitative testing of patients' blood for brodifacoum during outpatient follow-up visits to inform if patients continued or resumed use of synthetic cannabinoid products containing brodifacoum. In addition, serial blood brodifacoum concentrations allow for calculation of blood brodifacoum half-life and assist in determining duration of oral vitamin K1 therapy.

5. Ask all women of childbearing age who are on oral vitamin K1 therapy about the possibility of being pregnant and counsel them about reliable contraceptive techniques. A periodic pregnancy test should be performed on all women of childbearing age who are on oral vitamin K1 therapy. Pregnant patients on oral vitamin K1 should be referred for high-risk pregnancy management and follow-up.

6. Contact your local poison control center (1-800-222-1222) for questions on diagnostic testing and management of these patients.

7. Promptly report possible cases to your local or state health department.

**Recommendations for the Public**

1. CDC recommends that people do not use synthetic cannabinoid products. Synthetic cannabinoid products are always dangerous because it is impossible for people to know what chemicals are in the product, how much they are being exposed to, and how their body will react to the chemicals. The synthetic cannabinoid products associated with this outbreak are especially dangerous because they contain brodifacoum, a chemical used as rat poison that can cause uncontrolled bleeding.

2. People who have used synthetic cannabinoid products in the past three months and are concerned about their health should contact their healthcare provider. Synthetic cannabinoid products users who develop any unusual bruising or bleeding should immediately seek medical attention.

3. People who are currently on oral vitamin K1 treatment for brodifacoum poisoning should not use synthetic cannabinoid products, as this can cause new or worsening bleeding and may prolong the course of vitamin K1 treatment. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) national helpline, 1-800-662-HELP(4357), is a free, confidential, 24/7, 365-day-a-year treatment referral and information service in English and Spanish for individuals and families facing mental and/or substance use disorders.

4. Women who are currently on oral vitamin K1 treatment for brodifacoum poisoning should use an effective contraceptive method to prevent pregnancy while being treated.

* Amid surrounding ongoing Hepatitis A (HAV) outbreaks in multiple states, Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) has started to receive reports of increased activity in East-Central Illinois; the likelihood of travel to Chicago is high, which may lead to subsequent transmission within Chicago.

<!-- -->

* Healthcare providers should ensure adequate supply of hepatitis A vaccine and establish systems to vaccinate all adults at high risk of HAV infection, especially persons experiencing homelessness, men who have sex with men (MSM) and/or persons who use injection and non-injection drugs.

**Background:**Hepatitis A (HAV) outbreaks among persons reporting drug use or homelessness continue in Kentucky, West Virginia, Indiana, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee and Arkansas and, as of November 3, 2018, over 8,500 outbreak associated cases have been reported from 12 states. Statewide, Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) has not identified an overall increase in the number of acute HAV cases in 2018 compared to 2017. However, most recently, IDPH has identified an increase of cases among men who have sex with men (MSM) in East-Central Illinois. Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) has confirmed 58 HAV cases from January 2017 to present. Only 2 of the 24 cases reported in 2018 were MSM, though unrelated to the current cluster in East-Central Illinois.

Recently, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted unanimously to [add ""homelessness"" as a routine indication for HAV vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6743a3.htm?s_cid=mm6743a3_e). We recommend all providers screen their patients and provide HAV vaccine when indicated. While two doses are recommended to complete the series, even one dose provides nearly 95% immunity. This recommendation adds to the existing [routine vaccination guidance for drug use and MSM](https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/InterimOutbreakGuidance-HAV-VaccineAdmin.htm).

**Vaccine availability:** CDPH continues to partner with Howard Brown Health Center to make hepatitis A vaccine available to high-risk individuals who are uninsured or unable to pay. If you cannot provide hepatitis A vaccine or do not currently have stock of hepatitis A vaccine, please refer individuals to any of the following [Howard Brown locations](https://howardbrown.org/health-centers/). Patients can call to make an appointment at a specific location or present during hours of operation without an appointment and request vaccination.

* Healthcare providers may see an increase in the number of patients seeking evaluation, testing, prophylaxis or treatment for pertussis due to an ongoing outbreak at a Chicago area childcare center.
* Providers should ask for recent exposure in patients presenting with cough for over 14 days or who report exposure to pertussis. Pertussis vaccination history should not alter plans to test or prophylaxis.

**Background:**   
Chicago Department of Public Health has identified a pertussis outbreak at The Gardner School (2850 N Lincoln Ave). Six children 1-3 years of age have been diagnosed to date and approximately 100 individuals have been exposed over the past 2-3 weeks. Staff and parents of exposed children have been instructed to seek medical evaluation to receive either prophylaxis (if asymptomatic) or testing with treatment/prophylaxis (if symptomatic). Patients should be instructed to return to the childcare facility only when treatment is completed or prophylaxis has been initiated. Persons with pertussis are infectious from the beginning of the catarrhal stage (runny nose, sneezing, low-grade fever) through the third week after the onset of paroxysms (multiple, rapid coughs) or until 5 days after the start of effective antimicrobial treatment.   

**Recommendations:**   
**Suggested** Azithromycin dosing for prophylaxis or treatment: 0-5 months old \[10 mg/kg/day as a single dose for 5 days\]; 6 months and older \[10 mg/kg as a single dose on day 1 (max dose: 500mg), then 5 mg/kg/day (max dose: 250mg) as a single dose on days 2 through 5\]; Adolescents and adults \[500 mg as a single dose on day 1, then 250 mg as a single dose on days 2 through 5\]. For alternative therapies see [Clinical Guidelines for Testing and Treatment of Persons with Pertussis](https://www.chicagohan.org/documents/14171/49101/HealthUpdate_Pertussis_Testing_Treatment_08012012.pdf/c9872fed-b230-4311-914f-e9b2fa4c5aa4).   

**For Exposed Patients without Symptoms** : Prescribe antibiotic prophylaxis. See above.  

**For Exposed Patients with Symptoms:**   
For patients coughing \<21 days:  
1. Collect nasopharyngeal swabs or aspirate for pertussis PCR testing.  
2. Do not delay treatment with appropriate antibiotics while waiting for laboratory results if there is no alternative diagnosis.  
3. Provide documentation that verifies that the individuals are able to return to the daycare (this includes individuals for whom pertussis has been ruled out, children who have completed treatment or begun prophylaxis) and report any pertussis diagnoses to CDPH by calling 312-743-9000 or follow the instructions on [www.chicagohan.org/pertussis](https://www.chicagohan.org/pertussis).  
4. Strongly consider antibiotic prophylaxis for all household members if a pregnant woman, an infant less than 12 months old, or anyone with a weakened immune system lives in the household or if the family has regular contact with any known pertussis cases.

**For patients coughing ≥21 days:**   
1. Laboratory testing for pertussis is not necessary. CDC does not recommend laboratory testing after 3 weeks of cough since PCR and culture are only sensitive during the first 2 to 3 weeks of cough.  
2. For most patients, antibiotic treatment is not required after 21 days of cough, with the exception of infants and pregnant women in their third trimester up through 6 weeks after cough onset.  
3. The patient is no longer infectious and can return to school.

**For all households**: Administer Tdap to contacts 11 years or older who have not been previously vaccinated with Tdap, DTaP to contacts 2 months through 6 years who are not up-to-date, or refer for vaccination to a CDPH walk-in immunization clinic.
