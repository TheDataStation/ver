Will Caskey,"Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”; 5 ILCS 140/1 et seq), I hereby request disclosure of certain identified public records in the custody and control of the the Department of Family and Support Services.  I seek any and all documents or records, including but not limited to electronic documents, e-mails, paper documents, photographs (electronic or hard copy), or audio files, related to the below requests:  Specifically I seek the records, regarding Family and Support Services employee Paula Basta:  All emails, paper communications and records of telephone and in-person conversations regarding communication with Basta, or her immediate subordinates, and the Illinois Office of the Executive Inspector General, or individuals acting as agents on his behalf Basta’s salary, benefit and pension history for each year.  Any and all records of furlough days taken by Basta for each year.  Schedules or records reflecting Basta's activities, including any schedules arranged, noted, or otherwise recorded or created by Basta, or by any other person, computer program, or entity; Documents or records of charges and payments to any city credit cards issued to Basta, or provided for her use.  Telephone and cell phone records for Basta's office telephone and any state provided or paid cellular telephones. Copies of all outgoing emails sent from Basta's state email accounts including wireless devices, and all incoming e-mails.  Any and all records of hiring, promotion and termination of Family and Support Services employees reporting directly to Basta. Any and all disbursements to or on behalf of Basta for the purposes of travel, including receipts, expense sheets, request and approval forms, and stated purpose of travel.  Since most, if not all, of these requested public records are prepared and maintained on computer media, I am entitled to and specifically request their disclosure on computer media. [AFSCME v. County of Cook, 136 Ill. 2d 334 (1990)] Specifically, I presume that you maintain such public records in word processing, spreadsheet and/or database format and, while I prefer disclosure in Microsoft formats, I can read the computer file public records in any form in which they exist.  As a purchaser of the Microsoft Office Home and Student 2010 software, I am licensed to possess and use files in Microsoft formats and their disclosure is not subject to the trade secret exception in 7(1)(g) of FOIA. I purchased Microsoft Office Home and Student license # 01632-239-8105957-10061 in 2010. I invite you to confirm the licensee status with the software publisher.  Respecting my request for computer files of public records, I specifically request that they be immediately delivered to me, by electronic mail, on a CD-ROM or DVD disk. My ultimate preference for the lowest cost to the public and to the requester and promptness of disclosure is that all computerized records be disclosed by sending them as an attachment to the electronic mail address. If you choose to disclose the records other than by electronic mail, I request that I be notified by telephone (at the above stated number) and I will arrange for the documents to be delivered.  To the extent that any portions of or any of the public records I seek were not created on and/or are not preserved on electronic media, I seek their disclosure in any form in which they exist including true photocopies thereof.  To the extent that any portions of the public records I seek are exempt from disclosure for privacy or other reasons, I specifically request immediate disclosure of those portions of the public records which are not exempt by disclosing to me a copy of the public records with any exempt portions redacted. In addition, I request a specific explanation of the reasons why any records requested (or portions thereof) are not disclosed.  I stand ready to pay your administration any and all legally permitted fees and costs for the duplication of the public records I seek. If this amount exceeds $100, I request notification and my consent prior to the duplication of the records.  Thank you for your cooperation and assistance. Please reply at your earliest convenience (but in no case in excess of the time provided by FOIA) by electronic mail.",2011-09-19T00:00:00.000,2011-09-26T00:00:00.000,

The group would try to explore and present the different sides of every issue up for discussion and encourage participants to discuss their ideas about what they might responsibly do about their stand on the issue.

I am asking, if the plan has in fact been completed and submitted, that a copy be provided to me.2) In the letters of certification and policy committee membership roster, several delegate agencies appear to be missing. These are the ones I noted in a check against the grant application:- Ada S. McKinley Community Services- Chicago State University- Firman Community Services- Healing Temple of God in Christ- Henry Booth House- Lutheran Social Services of Illinois- North Avenue Day Nursery- Trinity Resources Unlimited- Trinity UCC- YMCA Metro Chicago.

Michael Ayele,"Thank you for your e-mail. I am in receipt of it. This is Michael A. Ayele sending this message though I now go by W. You may call me W. I am writing this letter in response to your latest correspondence, which I have read through. I am contacting you to file an appeal to the records request I had submitted with your offices dealing with the requirements of the Jeanne Ann Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act . Please be advised that I have concerns about your response.  Specifically, I am concerned about your failure to promptly disclose records detailing (1) the undergraduate, graduate and law schools you have previously attended and visited; (2) the time, the place and the manner in which you were first informed about the rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery. As a representative of the media and a member of the general public, I am worried about the manner in which I have come to be informed about the requirements of the Jeanne Ann Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act.  In hindsight, I am also worried about the manner in which I have come to be informed about the brutal rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery on April 1986. As a representative of the media and a member of the general public, I cannot recall any incident of rape and murder, which has had a more profound and devastating impact on American society and post-secondary education than that of Jeanne Ann Clery in the past 40 years. As a representative of the media and a member of the general public, I feel comfortable asserting that not much is known about Jeanne Ann Clery except what is told about her through others. Specifically, not much is known about what she thought of issues dealing with chauvinism, discrimination, misogyny, racism, and sexism. Please be advised that I have concerns about several reports, which mention the requirements of the Jeanne Ann Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act without referencing a paper written by Jeanne Ann Clery in high school and in her freshman year at Lehigh University. When I say: “I really don’t know Jeanne Ann Clery,” I mean that literally and figuratively. I have never met Jeanne Ann Clery: she died before I was born. I really don’t know what Jeanne Ann Clery would have thought of Donald Trump being invited at the graduation ceremony of Lehigh University Class of 1988 two years following her brutal rape and murder. I really don’t know what Jeanne Ann Clery would have thought about the decision of Lehigh University to extend an invitation to a man, who had not been respectful of affirmative and effective consent in his sexual relationships with women. I really don’t know what Jeanne Ann Clery would have thought of statements he made that have gone viral dealing with “grabbing women by the p****.” [i] I really don’t know what Jeanne Ann Clery would have thought about any man who would advocate for the death penalty in the State of New York, while treating women the way Donald Trump has. As a representative of the media and a member of the general public, I really can’t say “she would have approved of this,” and/or “she would have disapproved of that,” because of the lack of literature dealing with what she actually believed. As a representative of the media and a member of the general public, I really don’t know what you think of this as well. As a representative of the media and a member of the general public, I am worried about several colleges and universities I have previously attended and visited failing to mention the invitation that was extended to Donald Trump by Lehigh University in Fiscal Year 1988 on their websites and in their ASR. As a representative of the media and a member of the general public, I have concerns about Donald Trump being invited to speak at the graduation ceremony of Lehigh University Class of 1988 two years following the brutal rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery. As a representative of the media and a member of the general public, I find it problematic that someone who has not been respectful of affirmative and effective consent in his sexual relationships with women would in the State of New York advocate for the death penalty. I believe it to be troublesome. As a representative of the media and a member of the general public, I do believe college and university students of the USA should have the right to know that (1) Donald Trump was invited to speak at the graduation ceremony of Lehigh University Class of 1988 two years following the brutal death of Jeanne Ann Clery; (2) several credible news stories from reputable sources have indicated that Donald Trump has not been respectful of affirmative and effective consent in his sexual relationships with women; (3) Donald Trump has coerced the women he was not respectful of affirmative and effective consent to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA); (4) Lehigh University has recently rescinded the honorary degree awarded to Donald Trump in 1988 for unclear reason; (5) Donald Trump has advocated for the death penalty in the State of New York in the late 1980s; (6) the Department of Justice (DOJ) has resumed federal executions during his administration.  {US Government to Resume Executions After Nearly 2 Decades | Voice of America - English (voanews.com) } {US Carries Out 2nd Federal Execution This Week | Voice of America - English (voanews.com)} {US Executes First Woman Since 1953 | Voice of America - English (voanews.com)}  W (AACL), Anti-Racist Human Rights Activist, Audio-Visual Media Analyst, Anti-Propaganda Journalist. P.S: As a representative of the media and a member of the general public, I hope you will contact your alma mater and ask questions about why you were not informed about (1)  the invitation Donald Trump was extended by Lehigh University in Fiscal Year 1988 two years following the brutal death of Jeanne Ann Clery; (2) the honorary Degree he was bestowed in Fiscal Year 1988 two years following the brutal death and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery; (3) his failure to be respectful of affirmative and effective consent in his sexual relationships with women; (4) the NDA he had women with whom he was not respectful of affirmative and effective consent sign and; (5) his loud advocacy in favor of the death penalty in the state of New York in the late 1980s (if you have previously not been so).  I hope you will have in this Black History Month of Fiscal Year 2021 a conversation with your alma mater of events which were shared with you in the History classes you may have taken as a college/university student. I hope you will also have a discussion about the stories you were not.",2021-02-15T00:00:00.000,2021-03-08T00:00:00.000,

A log of all Freedom of Information Act requests made to Family & Support Services in 2021. 3. A log of all Freedom of Information Act requests made to Family & Support Services in 2020. Please provide the information in Excel. I would prefer the documents to be emailed to sarah@citybureau.org or shared through a file sharing service. If they must come in the form of a compact disc or paper, please address them to: Attn: Sarah Conway, 3619 S. State St., Suite 400, Chicago, IL 60609. Because I, the requestor, am a journalist, and I seek the information in order to disseminate it to the
public, and because the information from these reports regards the safety, welfare, and legal rights of the general public, the request meets the statutory definition of ""in the public interest.""
This request is not for commercial benefit, as defined in the statute. Additionally, this request is being made by a member of the news media whose principal purpose is to access and disseminate information regarding the general public's safety, welfare, and legal rights. Due to this I request a waiver of all fees associated with this request. To the extent you intend to assess any charges, please notify me to discuss first. This FOIA order is being sent via email during business hours on February 24, 2021. Aside from the potential that a court ultimately could impose a civil penalty of between $2,500 and $5,000 per FOIA violation, public bodies have an additional incentive to respond within five business days after receiving this FOIA order because in the event a public body fails to respond within 5 business days, it cannot charge for reproduction costs at a later time, or treat the request as unduly burdensome.",2021-02-24T00:00:00.000,2021-04-14T00:00:00.000,Civic Reporting Programs
