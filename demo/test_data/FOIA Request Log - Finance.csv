Toby Kalin/Patricia Kalin,Resident,"My wife and I visited Chicago by car arriving on 07/24/2022 – 07/27/2022.  During our stay at the Hotel Versey Days Inn on 644 West Diversey Parkway, our car was stolen from the parking garage on Tuesday, 07/26/2022.   We contacted the Chicago Police by phone, and reported the theft.  The reporting officer: Barbara Kinsella and approving supervisor Patrick Jaycox. The theft of our car required us to stay another night in the hotel, purchase airfare home to Cleveland, ship golf clubs home and many other expenses that were not reimbursed by our insurance.   We were notified by the Chicago police department on Thursday 07/28/2022 after we had arrived home, that our car had been recovered, and was in an impound lot in Chicago. The car was sent to an impound lot and we had to ask a relative who lives in Chicago to go and claim the car, pay the impound fees, and arrange for our car to be towed to River North Collision.   This also required us to write a letter, and have it notarized authorizing our relative to pick up the car.  The car was in repair for over 3 weeks, and we again needed to ask our relative to get the car, and drive it to Ohio. As you can see, the whole ordeal has been very troubling to us, and being out of town made the recovery even more stressful. To make matters worse, the people that stole our vehicle had a red light violation, and we received a ticket in the mail at the beginning of October for $100.00. I have tried since I received the ticket to speak with someone and have the ticket waived, as we were not driving the vehicle, it had been stolen and the thieves were joyriding. I have spent countless hours calling to the City of Chicago Department of Finance to get this cleared up.  Details of my attempts to clear this ticket are as follows: My first call was answered by a very nice man who advised all I needed to provide was the ticket number, and compose a short note advising our car had been stolen, and was not in our possession at that time of the violation.  As advised, I sent that to Po Box 6289 Chicago, IL 60608.I then received a letter from the finance department saying I needed to send a money order for $0.50 to get a copy of the police report. (This was not told to me by the individual I spoke with the first time I called) .  I called to confirm with the finance department, and as advised, I sent the requested money, along with a note requesting the police report. The clerk did not advise that I would also need a copy of the recovery report-so they could determine that we were not in possession of the car during that time. I received by mail a copy of the Chicago Police Department Original Case Incident Report. (no one told me if this was the same as the “Police Report”, and was then told I needed to send another $.50 to receive the General Offense Report Case. (I guess this is the same as the “Recovery Report”.  I sent in another $0.50 and I received a document titled: Police Records Inquiry’. (I don’t know what this is… and I received no document called the Recovery Report. This seems to me to be a request that should have been sent to the records area by someone in your department to send me the recovery report. I called my insurance company today 02/07/2023 to see if they would be able to rectify this issue. I also expected they would have a copy of the police report, and the recovery report- as they paid for the car repairs, and issued a check to us to cover those cost of repairs. I also called the Chicago Police Department today, who advised that she could again send me the police report again (she thought from what I explained that I already had this), but she did  not know what the Police Records Inquiry’ was.  She added that while she could provide the police records, the ticket issue would need to be resolved by the finance department.  SOMEONE PLEASE HELP MEEEEEEEEEE.As you can see, I am getting very frustrated over a ticket that was caused by the theft of our car.  My wife and I have spent hours on the phone, always talking to someone different, and having to tell our story over and over again.  On February 3rd, I received a letter dated January 24th indicating my ticket had now increased to $200.00. I think you can see that I have not thrown away the ticket, or ignored the situation.  I am trying to rectify this ticket which has been extremely hard.  Understand that as a citizen of another state, and not working in the law enforcement industry, your acronyms are difficult to understand.  I am emailing this letter to the FIOA as instructed, and also to the Chicago Department of Finance.  I am hoping between the two departments here, I will make some headway.   You my call me or my wife at the numbers below. I would appreciate follow up from someone in these Chicago departments so I can get this cleared.  A copy of my drivers license is also attached, as requested.",2023-02-08T00:00:00.000,2023-02-16T00:00:00.000

Victoria Watlington,"Watlington Engineering, PLLC","I am a PhD student and local elected official in Charlotte, NC. I'm writing to request data in support of my dissertation research (below). I am requesting to have the data from each city by January 15, 2023. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback regarding the clarity of the request.  Background To give you some context, here are the current versions of my research questions and data. Research Questions: 1. How does ideological alignment of state, local, and federal elected officials impact state and federal budget allocation (and, therefore) economic mobility across various city-state power dynamics? 2. How do racial demographics impact policy instrument selection and expenditures (and, therefore) economic mobility in large US cities? • How does African American percent of population impact policy instrument selection and budget allocation (and, therefore) economic mobility in large US cities? • How does segregation impact policy instrument selection and budget allocation (and, therefore) economic mobility in large US cities? • How does local African American affluence impact policy instrument selection and budget allocation (and, therefore) economic mobility in large US cities? (Are we lifting as we climb?) 3. How can quantitative decision support modeling be employed to improve the economic mobility budget allocation process?  Hypotheses: 1. Child-focused policies that are better funded increase mobility, assuming full utilization , 2. Home-rule cities are more likely to allocate and spend more on economic mobility programs., 3. When Democrat-led cities, states, and federal legislatures are governing simultaneously, economic mobility spending increases. (Will mobility?) 4. As segregation decreases, economic mobility program budget allocation and spending increases. Does mobility? 5. Cities in which African Americans have higher median incomes spend more on economic mobility programs. The goal is to then create a model that can forecast best policy portfolio selection for a local government based on the above control variables (authority, ideology, segregation, demographics, region). Data Request I'm looking for budget revenue sources (divided by federal, state, and local), allocation, AND expenditure data, by year, for FY2010-2020 for the top 50 cities in the US (as of 2020). Specifically, I'm looking for budget data for programs that fall within the economic mobility-related categories below. I understand that, for some cities/counties, many of these programs sit within the County budget. If that is the case, I would appreciate corresponding information from the County as well. For your reference, I am providing a work-in-progress example from the City of Charlotte (attached), as well as an alternative formatting example from Mecklenburg County (if possible, I would appreciate a similar format for ease of data consolidation). Examples of Investments/Programming Related to Economic Mobility Charter schools, Evidence-based math curricula, Evidence-based reading curricula, School-wide practices, Teacher training and professional development, Internships and apprenticeships, Job placement services, Re-entry programs, Sector-based skills training, Transitional jobs, Work readiness training, Career and technical education, Child wellness programs, Community schools, Dropout prevention programs, Ged/hsed programs ,Mentoring, counseling, and case management, School-based health programs, Sexual health programs, Substance use prevention programs, Summer jobs, Early childhood quality rankings systems, evidence-based childhood curricula, Preschool, Accelerated remedial education programs ,College access programs Dual enrollment/early college programs ,Financial aid completion support ,Post-secondary academic support, Post-secondary student guidance and support ,Post-secondary tuition support and incentives, SAT/ACT preparation programs, Diversion programs, Eviction, displacement, and homelessness prevention, Financial literacy programs, Financial navigators, Housing quality programs, Service-enriched housing, Transportation access, Unconditional cash supports, Health systems navigation assistance, High-quality childcare, Home visiting programs, Job quality, Living wage laws ,Parent training and support After-school, extracurricular, and summer programs, Nutrition programs, Restorative justice programs, Affordable housing creation and preservation, Built environment improvements, Community health programs, Direct health interventions, Health-related financial incentives, Neighborhood safety strategies, Upward mobility administration & training (not a policy), MWSBE business capacity building, Neighborhood capacity building (social/political capital), Home ownership",2022-12-22T00:00:00.000,2022-12-30T00:00:00.000

Matt Chapman,Freelance Reporter,"Pursuant to IL FOIA, please provide me with any and all documents associated with the permit process, budgeting, payment, approvals, certification, installation, maintenance, and/or labor (either prior, during or after) as they relate to the two devices, identified through the Department of Building (DoB) permits 100689347 and 100692764. These two devices, which appear to be shotspotter devices, were installed atop two CPD stations -- one on the 1438 W 63rd, and the other at 3315 W Ogden Ave. These devices appear to have both been installed in 2017 by Hartmann Electric Company and can be seen from the street. The type of documents this request seeks include scope of work, memos, design plans, fee documents, approvals, documents sufficient to show that installation work was done (partially or otherwise), cost and payment documents (eg receipts), contract(s) of vendor(s) and their subcontractor(s). At minimum, I expect to receive documents that were filed as a requirement of city ordinance for these sorts of installation (radio/communications/antenna/electrical work on top of a municipal building).  This request is being sent to multiple agencies who may have been involved in the process at some point.. and to avoid another game of FOIA hot potato. Because of the public's continued interest in ShotSpotter both at a local and national level, any burden incurred is well within the public's interest. This request does not seek the locations of any Shotspotter devices nor information that is exempt under the law. Should any information be exempt, please ensure that only the minimal redaction is done, even if that means providing a fully redacted document. My hope is that because the class of requested information is in many ways part of routine functions of the city (building maintenance, electrical work, etc), that the records will be found with little difficulty during a reasonable search. If that's not the case, or if my request is vague or overly broad, or for any other reason, please feel free to give me a call.",2022-10-17T00:00:00.000,2022-10-24T00:00:00.000

On 08/18/2022 at 10:51 a.m., I received a call back from 311 call taker ""Ms Miranda'. When I informed her that I wanted to call in a 'Vehicle Parked in Bike Lane' complaint, she immediately transferred me to a Chicago Police Department call taker who instructed me to report a 'Vehicle Parked in Bike Lane' to 911. This direction from the CPD call taker seems a bit much for a 'Vehicle Parked in Bike Lane' complaint.

My view is most if not all of this can be responded to by Finance but I want to head off either of your departments saying ""oh no we don't keep it, Budget/Finance does!"" To the FOIA request: This is a Freedom of Information Act request for the following records: 1.I am seeking electronic copies of all fines and fees the city of Chicago has issued for the following budget years (2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and so far this year) including how much was raised in each of those years for each of those fines, fees, penalties. 2.I am seeking the specific sources of the following local non-tax revenues, fines, forfeitures and penalties, charges for services , municipal parking , other revenue As well as their respective year end-balances for the following budget years: 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and so far this year.3. Any and all records showing how much the city received in Fines, Forfeitures, and Penalties in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and so far this year.As part of this request, I am seeking records sufficient to show a detailed breakdown of what went into that figure. (For instance: The city made $XX million in red light camera tickets, $XX million in speed camera tickets, $XX million in XX fines, which all added up shows the Fines, Forfeitures and Penalties total. I'm not just seeking the total amount but the pieces that add up to the total.) To be clear, the city budgets Fines, Forfeitures and Penalties so the Finance Department should know what goes into that. For your context, in 2019, under Rahm Emanuel, the city budgeted $345 million in Fines, Forfeitures and Penalties. For 2020, under Lori Lightfoot, the city proposed $342.7 million. For 2021, the city proposed $381.5 million, and for 2022, the city proposed $369.7 million.",2022-07-12T00:00:00.000,2022-07-19T00:00:00.000
