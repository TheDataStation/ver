I am happy for that clarification to happen via email or over the phone (202-716-3869). While I know that you are asking for clarification from me, I think it would help me help you if you could answer a couple questions I have about the guidance offered in your letter. First, in your letter you note that ""each of the individual Departments are a subsidiary body of the City of Chicago and are ""public bodies"" as defined by the FOIA). The City is comprised of many departments and a separate FOIA request must be directed to the department that maintains the records you are seeking."" Is this guidance? Should I be FOIA'ing other departments of the city? Or is this standard language for the city's response letters? I ask because the city's payments data does not include departments for the direct voucher payments I am interested in. If there are departments you feel that I should FOIA for responsive records, please let me know and I'll be happy to do so. Second, your letter notes that I could assist the department by providing a contract or PO number, 2) a specification number, 3) a project name, and 4) a timeframe to be searched. In many cases, the purchases I am interested in are direct voucher payments or purchases. Where the city's data indicates, I have provided the voucher number in question and the date of purchase. I have also provided a timeframe for purchases in my request. Both of these data points were included in the spreadsheet of purchases of interest which I attached to my FOIA.

Jacob Meeks,"After reviewing your response, I think it would be best to speak further about clarifying or revising the scope of my request. I am happy for that clarification to happen via email or over the phone (202-716-3869). While I know that you are asking for clarification from me, I think it would help me help you if you could answer a couple questions I have about the guidance offered in your letter. First, in your letter you note that ""each of the individual Departments are a subsidiary body of the City of Chicago and are ""public bodies"" as defined by the FOIA). The City is comprised of many departments and a separate FOIA request must be directed to the department that maintains the records you are seeking."" Is this guidance? Should I be FOIA'ing other departments of the city? Or is this standard language for the city's response letters? I ask because the city's payments data does not include departments for the direct voucher payments I am interested in. If there are departments you feel that I should FOIA for responsive records, please let me know and I'll be happy to do so. Second, your letter notes that I could assist the department by providing a contract or PO number, 2) a specification number, 3) a project name, and 4) a timeframe to be searched.

Fletcher Nickerson,"The company Genetec has taken a substantial role in shaping the way the Chicago Police Department both responds to incidents, both reported and predicted. Genetec’s Citigraf technology combines information from multiple sources of surveillance, such as the city’s network of surveillance cameras, and automated license plate readers. Despite Genetec now playing a large role in how the people of Chicago are policed, there is very little information available to the public on the agreements between the company and the city. These contracts could provide the people of Chicago with insight into how information collected about them is being stored and shared (such as logs of the whereabouts of everyday Chicagoans, collected by automated license plate readers). 

Pursuing the Illinois Freedom of Information Act, I am requesting the following records:

All contracts, licenses, MOUs, MOAs, data agreements, letters of intent, State of Work documents, Scope of Work documents, and other agreement documents with City of Chicago agencies (including but not limited to CPD, OEMC, and OPSA) from June 2014 to the present that include the keyword “Genetec”.

And all contracts, licenses, MOUs, MOAs, data agreements, letters of intent, State of Work documents, Scope of Work documents, and other agreement documents between City of Chicago agencies (including but not limited to CPD, OEMC, and OPSA) and the company Genetec from June 2014 to the present.

The Genetec contracts currently on the public DPS portal do not constitute responsive records. The only contracts currently available (1810, 14465, and 19793) expired before June 2014. Further, it is clear that the Chicago Police department has continued business with Genetec after contract 19793 expired. Genetec’s website states that in 2016, CPD “turned to Genetec” to develop the Citigraf application for their Strategic Decision Support Centers, which appears still to be in use (https://www.genetec.com/blog/industry/looking-for-cost-effective-crime-center-technology).

In the event that DPS is not in possession of these records, you are obligated to retrieve them pursuant to the FOIA: see `(2) A public record that is not in the possession of a public body but is in the possession of a party with whom the agency has contracted to perform a governmental function on behalf of the public body, and that directly relates to the governmental function and is not otherwise exempt under this Act, shall be considered a public record of the public body, for purposes of this Act.`

This request is being made on the behalf of Lucy Parsons Labs. The requested documents will be made available to the general public, and this request is not being made for commercial purposes.",2021-12-30T00:00:00.000,2022-01-07T00:00:00.000,

Clarification: the CITY-BASED BUSINESS AFFIDAVIT form states the following –
“Bidder understands that it may be required to produce records to the chief procurement officer to verify the information provided.”
My FOIA request seeks any documentation submitted by Benchmark that was used by the City to verify Benchmark’s claim that they are a City based business. This applies to the following contracts:

Clarification: as an example –

Bid Results using Award Criteria:
1.	Benchmark $3,073,391.58

one is at the corner of broadway and belle plaine or at about 4100 north broadway.  there is a city pod across the street from the installation.   What are the equipment specifications?  what were the costs? who owns it?  What department is responsible for it's management or care?  what was the erection date?    If you do not have this information, please direct me to the appropriate city department.  

another is at the corner of lawrence and the lakeshore interchange.  it is on the corner of the north west quadrant of the interchange or on the off ramp for southbound traffic.  Google sites this location as 141 w diversey parkway.  this device located on this lamp post is smaller, but it seems to have had a pod (police observation device ) attached at one time or was equiped for one, that is now missing or was never installed.  What are the equipment specifications?  what were the costs? who owns it?  What department is responsible for it's management or care?  what was the erection date?    If you do not have this information, please direct me to the appropriate city department.  

the third is at the corner of clark and belmont streets, in the south west corner.  as recent as july 2019 this location had a single pod camera, and then it transformed into a substantial mass of equipment, and it may have been altered again, removing or changing some of the equipment.

Katy Smyser,"First, please forgive me if I have incorrect FOIA contact information.  If you can let me know if I need to redirect this request to a different email or different name, I’d really appreciate it, and I promise to update my contact list for future FOIAs.

I am making this request of all governmental entities across the greater Chicago area, as I gather material on all unclaimed funds held by (or due to) people and entities in our area, including the Chicago Department of Procurement Services.  I am preparing a series of reports on the scope and breadth of unclaimed money due to Chicago-area individuals, governmental bodies, and others.
 
This is a three-part request.  If these documents are controlled by a separate office or governmental entity, it’s likely I’ve sent a similar FOIA request to them as well.  Conversely, if your office handles this material for other offices or departments, be aware that I’ve probably sent a FOIA request to them as well.  I’m hoping that, wherever possible, such FOIAs can be combined, to avoid multiple offices having to respond with the same paperwork and data.
 
First, I am requesting all documents, data, and/or spreadsheets sufficient to show all unclaimed funds under the control of the Chicago Department of Procurement Services which have NOT been reported or transferred to the Illinois State Treasurer for inclusion in the state’s Unclaimed Property fund and database.  This would include unclaimed money and property that is not yet old enough to be transferred to the Treasurer, including unclaimed refunds of any type; uncashed and/or “stale” checks or warrants; refunds or reimbursements for taxes, tuition, housing, incidentals, insurance payments, expenses, or any other type of refund or reimbursement; and all other unclaimed property and money which is currently under the control of your agency.  For all documents, data or spreadsheets that contain information on these unclaimed funds, I am requesting all fields of data, including the specific amount of each unclaimed fund; the name and the address of each person or entity to which each fund is due; a description of what each piece of unclaimed property or money is; any control number or property number attached to each property; and any applicable dates connected with each piece of unclaimed property.
 
Second, I am requesting documents, data, and/or spreadsheets showing all unclaimed property which your office HAS reported and/or transferred to the Illinois State Treasurer, in response to the requirements of Illinois’ Revised Uniform Unclaimed Property Act, from January 1, 2016 to the present.  I request that these documents, data and/or spreadsheets include all available fields, including the specific amount of each parcel of unclaimed property which was reported and/or transferred to the Illinois Treasurer’s office; a description of what the property or cash is; the name and address of the person or entity due the property or cash; any date associated with each parcel of unclaimed property or cash; and any control number or other reference number for the property or cash.
 
Third, I am requesting documents, data and/or spreadsheets showing all claims for unclaimed property DUE TO the Chicago Department of Procurement Services FROM the Illinois Treasurer’s Unclaimed Property fund, for which you have submitted a claim or documentation to the Illinois Treasurer’s Office, from January 1, 2016 to the present, including the amount of each property claimed; the date your office submitted the claim, the property ID number from the Illinois State Treasurer’s Unclaimed Property database, and the current status of each claim you submitted (i.e., whether you received the property or money, or whether the claim is still pending).",2021-10-05T00:00:00.000,2021-10-12T00:00:00.000,NBC5 Chicago

I am requesting a copy of the following documents: requests for proposal (RFP), bid packages, bid tabulations, and contracts associated with the name Demetri Combs or DEMETRI COMBS. Also, within this FOIA request, I request a copy of all performance and payment bonds associated with the name(s) Demetri Combs or DEMETRI COMBS.
Through various forms of communication, the City of Chicago and agents on its behalf have claimed through prima. facia and presumptions that I have willfully promised to perform certain obligations this includes financial obligations. I declare that these presumptions deprive me of substantive rights and substantive due process of law.
As you know, FOIA requires agencies to release information unless it is specifically exempt from disclosure and requires agencies to release all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions of documents, i.e., to redact exempt portions of documents and release the rest. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(8). To help to determine my status for purposes of determining any applicability to the requested information and documentation, you should know that I am a living breathing conscious man whose age is of majority and an Illinoisan state citizen currently domiciling in the commonwealth of Illinois. Also, that the name(s) Demetri Combs and DEMETRI COMBS personally identifies me.
The requested information is solely for educational research and personal use purposes only and is not intended for commercial use with a private corporation nor use in any companies' business.
Lastly, I request a waiver of all fees for this request. Disclosure of the requested information to me is in favor of the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in my commercial interest. It is a fundamental principle that involuntary servitude whether by financial means, physical, or covenant is morally wrong as established by the 13th Amendment of the Constitution. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that it is of public opinion that no individual or group would willfully be subjected to any form of servitude including being manipulated into covenants. Disclosing the requested documents without charge of fees will benefit the public by reminding the public that oppression and deception are morally wrong and is not how the constitution nor God intended human relations to be based upon.

He was executed by the State of Missouri on May 19th 2020. According to the Innocence Project, Walter Barton was at the time of his execution (1) likely innocent of the crimes he had been charged with in Fiscal Year (F.Y) 1991; (2) a man who had been tried five times and had two convictions overturned for the crimes he had been charged with in F.Y 1991; (3) a man who was convicted by a special unit in the Missouri Attorney General Office that had previously “misstated the evidence;” (4) a man who had woefully inadequate counsel; (5) the first person to be executed (by the State of Missouri) since the coronavirus outbreak hit the United States of America (U.S.A). vii On these bases alone, I believe this request for records should be expedited and all fees waived. In addition to Walter Barton, the records sought in this request have demonstrated that Ernest Lee Johnson physical safety and well-being are at risk. As a former employee of the DMH Fulton State Hospital (FSH), I really don’t know if Ernest Lee Johnson was ever a patient of the DMH. As a former employee of the DMH, I also don’t know if psychologists/psychiatrists working for the DMH have previously opined that Ernest Lee Johnson was a person with a developmental and/or an intellectual disability. In e-mail correspondences I have exchanged with my former employers, I have urged them to submit without delay (to the judicial branch of the Missouri government) any medical opinion drafted by a psychologist/psychiatrist associated with the DMH affirming that Ernest Lee Johnson was a person with a developmental and/or an intellectual disability (if such records are indeed within their possession). As a representative of the media and a member of the general public, I have recently come to be informed that my former employers don’t have a position about the capital punishment of people (living within the State of Missouri) who have been described by the media as having a developmental and/or an intellectual disability. Please be advised that I am (as a representative of the media and a member of the general public) opposed to the death penalty in part because of the several issues raised in this records W (AACL) - MICHAEL A. AYELE 4 REQUEST FOR RECORDS request. In his 1996 HBO special entitled Back in Town, George Carlin says of social conservatives that they're “all in favor of the unborn. They will do anything for the unborn. But once you’re born, you’re on your own. Pro-life conservatives are obsessed with the fetus from conception to nine months. After that, they don’t want to know about you. No nothing! No neonatal care, no day care, no Head Start, no school lunch, no food stamps, no welfare, no nothing! If you're pre-born, you're fine. If you're preschool, you're f*****.” viii As a representative of the media and a member of the general public, I recommend for you to watch George Carlin stand-up comedy entitled “Back in Town” for its entertainment and informational value. As you may remember, Eddie Murphy had previously described George Carlin as “the greatest” and “funniest” comedian of all time in a speech he gave at the Mark Twain awards.ix As a representative of the media and a member of the general public, I encourage you to reflect about the message the State of Missouri is sending by executing a person described by several news outlets as intellectually and developmentally disabled. I also encourage you to ponder the following questions I’ve been thinking about. Is it likely that Ernest Lee Johnson would have been found incompetent to stand trial because of a mental disorder had he been charged with Trespass (say in the State of Maryland)? Is it likely that Ernest Lee Johnson would have been found unable to assist his legal counsel in the preparation of his criminal trial had he been charged with Trespass (say in the State of Maryland)? Is it prudent for the criminal justice system to send the message that people such as Ernest Lee Johnson (among others similarly situated) are too dumb and/or stupid to stand trial for the petty offense of Trespass (say in the State of Maryland) because of a mental disorder and/or a developmental disability? Is it prudent for the criminal justice system to send the message that people such as Ernest Lee Johnson (among others similarly) are intelligent enough to be held accountable and be put to death? I mean: which is it? Could a person found incompetent to stand trial for the petty offense of Trespass (say in the State of Maryland) be intelligent enough to face the death penalty? Take care. The Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Information Policy (OIP) defines a “perfected” FOIA request as a request for records which adequately describes the records sought, that has been received by the FOIA office of the agency or agency component in possession of the records, and for which there is no remaining question about the payment of applicable fees.x The Association for the Advancement of Civil Liberties (AACL) is a non-governmental organization (NGO). As its Founding Member, I, W had previously been informed that forms 1023, 2848, 5578, 5768 and SS4 were filed with the Internal Revenue Services (IRS). The AACL does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation or any other attribute people may associate themselves with.xi The AACL does not represent in any way whatsoever the views of the executive, judicial and legislative branches of the U.S government. I, W am a member of the general public: I am a representative of the media.xii I, W have contributed several articles xiii on the Huffington Post.xiv The other has mentioned my YouTube channel on numerous occasions to me.xv I have previously used YouTube, xvi Scribd, xvii and Archive.org xviii to publish documents obtained through records request and will continue to do so in the future. I have also begun to use the blogging platform Medium to publish content obtained through records request.xix If you wish, you can like and subscribe to my YouTube Channels. You can also applaud or make a comment on the stories I have published on Medium if you wish to do so.xx The AACL is primarily engaged in disseminating information within the meaning of the statute 5 U.S.C § 552 (a)(6)(E)(v)(II). Obtaining information about government activity, analyzing that information, and widely publishing and disseminating information to the press and public are W (AACL) - MICHAEL A. AYELE 5 REQUEST FOR RECORDS critical and substantial components of the AACL work.xxi The records requested are not sought for commercial purposes and I, W plan to disseminate the information disclosed as a result of this request to the public at no cost. These records are urgently needed to inform the public about actual or alleged government activity. It is my opinion, that the AACL has satisfied the requirements for expedited processing of this request. The AACL requests a waiver on document search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is in the public interest and because disclosure is “likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” 5 U.S.C § 552 (a)(4)(A)(iii). The AACL also requests a waiver of search fees on the grounds that the AACL qualifies as a “representative of the news media” and the records are not sought for commercial use. 5 U.S.C § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). Given the ongoing attention of the AACL to the issues presented, it is the opinion of the AACL that the records sought will significantly contribute to public understanding of an issue of profound public importance. City of Baltimore v Burke? Project on Military Procurement v Dept of Navy? The AACL is not filing this request to further its commercial interest. As previously mentioned, any information disclosed by the AACL as a result of this request for records will be available to the public at no cost. Thus, a fee waiver would fulfill Congress’s legislative intent in amending the FOIA. Has Congress not amended FOIA to ensure that it be liberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters? Judicial Watch, Inc v Rossotti? Eudey v CIA? Does burden for justifying nondisclosure fall upon the agency who is in receipt of a request for records? Petroleum Inf. Corp v U.S Dept of Interior?

What I am requesting for prompt disclosure are all records within your possession detailing (1) formal and informal ties existing between your offices, the Missouri Department of Mental Health (DMH), the Missouri State Employee Retirement System (MOSERS), Amnesty International, the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Council on Disability (NCD), the National Archives Records Administration (NARA), the Social Security Administration (SSA), the United States Department of State (DoS), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Education (DoED), the Department of Commerce, the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB), the Innocence Project Group and the office of Jean Peters Baker; (2) your communications in the form of emails and postal correspondence about your obligations pursuant to the Genetics Information and Nondiscrimination Act (GINA); (3) your communications in the form of e-mails and postal correspondence about the DOJ (FBI) and the MSHP background check I had passed in Fiscal Year (F.Y) 2013 before I began my employment with the Missouri Department of Mental Health (DMH) Fulton State Hospital (FSH) located 600 East 5th Street, Fulton, Missouri; (4) your communications in the form of e-mails and postal correspondence about the DMH and the MOSERS having recently come to recognize that I was paid the amount of $663 (six hundred sixty-three U.S dollars); $1,215 (twelve hundred and fifteen U.S dollars); $1,215 (twelve hundred and fifteen U.S dollars); $1,215 (twelve hundred and fifteen U.S dollars); $1,243 (twelve hundred and forty three U.S dollars); $3,888 (thirty eight hundred and eighty eight U.S dollars); $1,285 (twelve hundred and eighty five U.S dollars); $2,572 (twenty five hundred and seventy two U.S dollars); $1,291 (twelve hundred and ninety one U.S dollars); $3,306 (thirty three hundred and six U.S dollars); $1,291 (twelve hundred and ninety one U.S dollars) and $533 (five hundred and thirty three U.S dollars) between July 15th 2013 until January 15th 2014 for the work I performed in my former capacity as a Forensic Rehab Specialist (FRS); (5) your communications in the form of e-mails and postal correspondence about the July 02nd 2021 records request I had submitted with the Missouri Department of Mental Health (DMH) and the National Council on Disability (NCD) hereby attached in Appendix C; (6) your communications in the form of e-mails and postal correspondence about the State of Missouri plans to execute a man described by several news W (AACL) - MICHAEL A. AYELE 3 REQUEST FOR RECORDS outlets as someone who’s intellectually/developmentally disabled; (7) the I.Q number the EEOC, the HHS, the DOJ, the SSA and your mental health offices consider to be average; (8) the I.Q number the EEOC, the HHS, the SSA and your offices take into consideration when determining a person to be intellectually/developmentally disabled; (9) your official position about the capital punishment of people with below average I.Q; (10) all Amicus Curiae brief filed by your offices in the judicial branch of the U.S government on behalf of an intellectually disabled person to prevent a capital punishment from taking place because of their documented long-term intellectual disabilities; (11) your communications in the form of e-mails and postal correspondence about Amnesty International and the Innocence Project Group having noted that Walter “Arkie” Barton was executed by the State of Missouri even though he was likely an innocent man wrongfully sentenced to death; (12) your communications in the form of e-mails and postal correspondence Jean Peters Baker apology to Kevin Strickland; (13) your communications in the form of e-mails and postal correspondence about Jean Peters Baker interview with Rachel Maddow dated June 19th 2021 on MSNBC; (14) your communications in the form of e-mails and postal correspondence about the several articles published by the Kansas City Star accusing Missouri Governor Michael Parson of playing politics with the life of Kevin Strickland; (15) your communications in the form of e-mails and postal correspondence about the need for the State of Missouri to put in place a moratorium, which would lead for the eventual abolishment of the death penalty. 2) Request for a Fee Waiver and Expedited Processing The requested records have already posed an imminent threat to the physical safety and wellbeing of Walter Barton. He was executed by the State of Missouri on May 19th 2020. According to the Innocence Project, Walter Barton was at the time of his execution (1) likely innocent of the crimes he had been charged with in Fiscal Year (F.Y) 1991; (2) a man who had been tried five times and had two convictions overturned for the crimes he had been charged with in F.Y 1991; (3) a man who was convicted by a special unit in the Missouri Attorney General Office that had previously “misstated the evidence;” (4) a man who had woefully inadequate counsel; (5) the first person to be executed (by the State of Missouri) since the coronavirus outbreak hit the United States of America (U.S.A). vii On these bases alone, I believe this request for records should be expedited and all fees waived. In addition to Walter Barton, the records sought in this request have demonstrated that Ernest Lee Johnson physical safety and well-being are at risk. As a former employee of the DMH Fulton State Hospital (FSH), I really don’t know if Ernest Lee Johnson was ever a patient of the DMH. As a former employee of the DMH, I also don’t know if psychologists/psychiatrists working for the DMH have previously opined that Ernest Lee Johnson was a person with a developmental and/or an intellectual disability. In e-mail correspondences I have exchanged with my former employers, I have urged them to submit without delay (to the judicial branch of the Missouri government) any medical opinion drafted by a psychologist/psychiatrist associated with the DMH affirming that Ernest Lee Johnson was a person with a developmental and/or an intellectual disability (if such records are indeed within their possession). As a representative of the media and a member of the general public, I have recently come to be informed that my former employers don’t have a position about the capital punishment of people (living within the State of Missouri) who have been described by the media as having a developmental and/or an intellectual disability. Please be advised that I am (as a representative of the media and a member of the general public) opposed to the death penalty in part because of the several issues raised in this records W (AACL) - MICHAEL A. AYELE 4 REQUEST FOR RECORDS request. In his 1996 HBO special entitled Back in Town, George Carlin says of social conservatives that they're “all in favor of the unborn. They will do anything for the unborn. But once you’re born, you’re on your own. Pro-life conservatives are obsessed with the fetus from conception to nine months. After that, they don’t want to know about you. No nothing! No neonatal care, no day care, no Head Start, no school lunch, no food stamps, no welfare, no nothing! If you're pre-born, you're fine. If you're preschool, you're f*****.” viii As a representative of the media and a member of the general public, I recommend for you to watch George Carlin stand-up comedy entitled “Back in Town” for its entertainment and informational value. As you may remember, Eddie Murphy had previously described George Carlin as “the greatest” and “funniest” comedian of all time in a speech he gave at the Mark Twain awards.ix As a representative of the media and a member of the general public, I encourage you to reflect about the message the State of Missouri is sending by executing a person described by several news outlets as intellectually and developmentally disabled. I also encourage you to ponder the following questions I’ve been thinking about. Is it likely that Ernest Lee Johnson would have been found incompetent to stand trial because of a mental disorder had he been charged with Trespass (say in the State of Maryland)? Is it likely that Ernest Lee Johnson would have been found unable to assist his legal counsel in the preparation of his criminal trial had he been charged with Trespass (say in the State of Maryland)? Is it prudent for the criminal justice system to send the message that people such as Ernest Lee Johnson (among others similarly situated) are too dumb and/or stupid to stand trial for the petty offense of Trespass (say in the State of Maryland) because of a mental disorder and/or a developmental disability? Is it prudent for the criminal justice system to send the message that people such as Ernest Lee Johnson (among others similarly) are intelligent enough to be held accountable and be put to death? I mean: which is it? Could a person found incompetent to stand trial for the petty offense of Trespass (say in the State of Maryland) be intelligent enough to face the death penalty? Take care. The Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Information Policy (OIP) defines a “perfected” FOIA request as a request for records which adequately describes the records sought, that has been received by the FOIA office of the agency or agency component in possession of the records, and for which there is no remaining question about the payment of applicable fees.x The Association for the Advancement of Civil Liberties (AACL) is a non-governmental organization (NGO). As its Founding Member, I, W had previously been informed that forms 1023, 2848, 5578, 5768 and SS4 were filed with the Internal Revenue Services (IRS). The AACL does not discriminate on the basis of gender, race, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation or any other attribute people may associate themselves with.xi The AACL does not represent in any way whatsoever the views of the executive, judicial and legislative branches of the U.S government. I, W am a member of the general public: I am a representative of the media.xii I, W have contributed several articles xiii on the Huffington Post.xiv The other has mentioned my YouTube channel on numerous occasions to me.xv I have previously used YouTube, xvi Scribd, xvii and Archive.org xviii to publish documents obtained through records request and will continue to do so in the future. I have also begun to use the blogging platform Medium to publish content obtained through records request.xix If you wish, you can like and subscribe to my YouTube Channels. You can also applaud or make a comment on the stories I have published on Medium if you wish to do so.xx The AACL is primarily engaged in disseminating information within the meaning of the statute 5 U.S.C § 552 (a)(6)(E)(v)(II). Obtaining information about government activity, analyzing that information, and widely publishing and disseminating information to the press and public are W (AACL) - MICHAEL A. AYELE 5 REQUEST FOR RECORDS critical and substantial components of the AACL work.xxi The records requested are not sought for commercial purposes and I, W plan to disseminate the information disclosed as a result of this request to the public at no cost. These records are urgently needed to inform the public about actual or alleged government activity. It is my opinion, that the AACL has satisfied the requirements for expedited processing of this request. The AACL requests a waiver on document search, review, and duplication fees on the grounds that disclosure of the requested records is in the public interest and because disclosure is “likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” 5 U.S.C § 552 (a)(4)(A)(iii). The AACL also requests a waiver of search fees on the grounds that the AACL qualifies as a “representative of the news media” and the records are not sought for commercial use. 5 U.S.C § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II). Given the ongoing attention of the AACL to the issues presented, it is the opinion of the AACL that the records sought will significantly contribute to public understanding of an issue of profound public importance. City of Baltimore v Burke? Project on Military Procurement v Dept of Navy? The AACL is not filing this request to further its commercial interest. As previously mentioned, any information disclosed by the AACL as a result of this request for records will be available to the public at no cost. Thus, a fee waiver would fulfill Congress’s legislative intent in amending the FOIA. Has Congress not amended FOIA to ensure that it be liberally construed in favor of waivers for noncommercial requesters? Judicial Watch, Inc v Rossotti? Eudey v CIA? Does burden for justifying nondisclosure fall upon the agency who is in receipt of a request for records? Petroleum Inf. Corp v U.S Dept of Interior? I hereby declare under penalty of perjury that all the statements I have made are to the best of my knowledge true and accurate.",2021-07-23T00:00:00.000,2021-07-30T00:00:00.000,

(See pages 18 – 24 of the NCD March 22nd 2018 report.) What feedback were provided by the HHS (CMS), the HHS (SAMHSA), the HHS (ACL), the HHS (NIH), the NIDLILRR, the V.A, the DoED (OSEP), the DoED (OSERS), the NQE, the UCEDD, the P&A, the DOJ, the SSA and the GAO to the NCD March 22nd 2018 report having noted that the way “capacity determinations are made is deeply problematic. Many states rely heavily on physicians and psychiatrists, who provide opinions that are based largely on generalities on a person’s diagnosis rather than on any observable trait of the particular individual. Although statutes that require a physician or psychiatrist to report to the court regarding the capacity of the individual are based on the assumption that these scientists will submit to the court an unbiased and scientifically based opinion, physicians and psychiatrists are often not trained in administering the kinds of tests that may provide the most insight into an individual’s ability to make decisions and might not have the requisite skills and experience with the particular disability to render a valid judgment. (…) Even if they have a clinical basis for determining what a person can or cannot do, the experts that make these determinations may not have sufficient legal context to determine whether the individual is incapacitated as the law defines it. In one study, only 30 percent of doctors were able to correctly apply the definition of legal competence (capacity) in a fact-pattern drawn from an actual legal case. Additionally, although psychiatrists were able to answer theoretical questions about the standards for legal capacity, they were often wrong when applying those standards to facts. In addition, only a small minority of doctors were able to understand that a person could be diagnosed with dementia or depression and W (AACL) - MICHAEL A. AYELE 4 REQUEST FOR RECORDS still be legally competent. Medical doctors simply are trained in the legal, functional, and medical assessments that could lead to a reliable determination regarding an individual’s capacity. (…) Even in the best-case scenario in which a physician with relevant expertise is appointed, the medical profession’s relationship to disability has historically been a paternalistic one. In medical terms, a patient benefits from anything that reverses or ameliorates any disease or disability ‘…that threatens to shorten the life or limit the functional capacity of the patient. Harm is characterized as anything that impedes or compromises the efficacy of those diagnostic or therapeutic measures.’ This weighs heavily in favor of restricting autonomy in an attempt to ensure safety and may inevitably lead to overly restrictive guardianships?” (See pages 77 - 80 of the report.) What feedback were provided by the HHS (CMS), the HHS (SAMHSA), the HHS (ACL), the HHS (NIH), the NIDLILRR, the V.A, the DoED (OSEP), the DoED (OSERS), the NQE, the UCEDD, the P&A, the DOJ, the SSA and the GAO to the NCD having noted in their March 22nd 2018 report that “sexuality is an incredibly fraught topic for people with disabilities that raises issues not only about consent and mental capacity, but also ‘the forced sterilization of people with disabilities, the rights of people with disabilities in institutions to have sex and be free from sexual abuse, and the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people with disabilities. Against this complex backdrop, NCD recognizes that ‘the desire to enter into intimate personal relationships, including sexual relationships, is one of the most personal rights there is’ and that ‘desire is no less important for the many adults with disabilities who are under some form of guardianship?’” (See page 106 of the report.) 3) What communications in the form of e-mails and postal correspondence have you had about the circumstances, which led to the much-publicized emotional duress and distress experienced by Britney Spears in 2007?

Many states rely heavily on physicians and psychiatrists, who provide opinions that are based largely on generalities on a person’s diagnosis rather than on any observable trait of the particular individual. Although statutes that require a physician or psychiatrist to report to the court regarding the capacity of the individual are based on the assumption that these scientists will submit to the court an unbiased and scientifically based opinion, physicians and psychiatrists are often not trained in administering the kinds of tests that may provide the most insight into an individual’s ability to make decisions and might not have the requisite skills and experience with the particular disability to render a valid judgment. (…) Even if they have a clinical basis for determining what a person can or cannot do, the experts that make these determinations may not have sufficient legal context to determine whether the individual is incapacitated as the law defines it. In one study, only 30 percent of doctors were able to correctly apply the definition of legal competence (capacity) in a fact-pattern drawn from an actual legal case. Additionally, although psychiatrists were able to answer theoretical questions about the standards for legal capacity, they were often wrong when applying those standards to facts. In addition, only a small minority of doctors were able to understand that a person could be diagnosed with dementia or depression and still be legally competent. Medical doctors simply are trained in the legal, functional, and medical assessments that could lead to a reliable determination regarding an individual’s capacity. (…) Even in the best-case scenario in which a physician with relevant expertise is appointed, the medical profession’s relationship to disability has historically been a paternalistic one. In medical terms, a patient benefits from anything that reverses or ameliorates any disease or disability ‘…that threatens to shorten the life or limit the functional capacity of the patient.

Many states rely heavily on physicians and psychiatrists, who provide opinions that are based largely on generalities on a person’s diagnosis rather than on any observable trait of the particular individual. Although statutes that require a physician or psychiatrist to report to the court regarding the capacity of the individual are based on the assumption that these scientists will submit to the court an unbiased and scientifically based opinion, physicians and psychiatrists are often not trained in administering the kinds of tests that may provide the most insight into an individual’s ability to make decisions and might not have the requisite skills and experience with the particular disability to render a valid judgment. (…) Even if they have a clinical basis for determining what a person can or cannot do, the experts that make these determinations may not have sufficient legal context to determine whether the individual is incapacitated as the law defines it. In one study, only 30 percent of doctors were able to correctly apply the definition of legal competence (capacity) in a fact-pattern drawn from an actual legal case. Additionally, although psychiatrists were able to answer theoretical questions about the standards for legal capacity, they were often wrong when applying those standards to facts. In addition, only a small minority of doctors were able to understand that a person could be diagnosed with dementia or depression and still be legally competent. Medical doctors simply are trained in the legal, functional, and medical assessments that could lead to a reliable determination regarding an individual’s capacity. (…) Even in the best-case scenario in which a physician with relevant expertise is appointed, the medical profession’s relationship to disability has historically been a paternalistic one. In medical terms, a patient benefits from anything that reverses or ameliorates any disease or disability ‘…that threatens to shorten the life or limit the functional capacity of the patient. Harm is characterized as anything that impedes or compromises the efficacy of those diagnostic or therapeutic measures.’ This weighs heavily W (AACL) - MICHAEL A.

Please be advised that I have concerns about your response. In fact, I am worried. According to the official website of the Missouri Department of Mental Health (DMH), the “Missouri Department of Mental Health was first established as a cabinet-level state agency by the Omnibus State Government Reorganization Act, effective July 1, 1974. State law provides three principal missions for the department: (1) the prevention of mental disorders, developmental disabilities, substance abuse, and compulsive gambling; (2) the treatment, habilitation, and rehabilitation of Missourians who have those conditions; and (3) the improvement of public understanding and attitudes about mental disorders, developmental disabilities, substance abuse, and compulsive gambling. The seven-member Missouri Mental Health Commission, serves as the principal policy advisory body to the department director. The department is composed of three divisions: the Division of Behavioral Health, the Division of Developmental Disabilities and the Division of Administrative Services, as well as seven support offices. DMH serves approximately 170,000 Missourians annually through state-operated facilities and contracts with private organizations and individuals. The seven state-operated psychiatric facilities include inpatient psychiatric care for adults and children, as well as sex offender rehabilitation and treatment services.

Via e-mail dated July 13th 2021, the DMH provided records they deemed responsive to my June 26th 2021 request. As previously mentioned, those records disclosed by the DMH have been hereby attached in Appendix A. In the e-mail I had sent the DMH, I had expressed concerns about their failure to promptly disclose records within their possession pertaining to (1) patient/prisoner James White using the N-word and physically charging at me; (2) patient/prisoner James White using the N-word in reference to other staff members of the Fulton State Hospital (FSH), who were assigned to the Program for Recovery Initiation and Self-Motivation (PRISM) at the time I was a public employee regularly assigned to that program; (3) patient/prisoner James White using the N-word in reference to patients of the Biggs Forensic Center (BFC) PRISM; (4) patient/prisoner James White targeting patients, W (AACL) - MICHAEL A. AYELE 2 FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA) REQUEST who were Blacks/African Americans to physically attack them. As of this writing, the DMH do not deny that (1) since the moment of his arrival as a patient/prisoner at the FSH (BFC), James White began referring to me as a “N*****;” (2) James White referred to other Blacks/African American staff regularly assigned to the PRISM as “N******;” (3) James White referred to other Blacks/African American patients/prisoners of the FSH (BFC) as “N******;” (4) I had separated a physical altercation involving James White and a Black/African patient/prisoner whose name was Claudel after James White physically attacked Claudel in the day-room of the PRISM after having called him a “N*****;” (5) James White at a later date following his altercation with patient/prisoner Claudel physically attacked me after having called me a “N*****;” (6) I became a float employee no longer routinely assigned to the PRISM after I had separated a physical attack of James White directed at Claudel; (7) I became a float employee no longer routinely assigned to the PRISM after having vocally objected to being called a “N*****;” (8) I became a float employee no longer routinely assigned to the PRISM after having been vocally discouraged to report James White abusive behavior and the manner it was being logged on his Personal Health Information (PHI). As a former employee of the DMH, I regret the decision of the FSH not to promptly disclose audio and video footage of James White physical aggression and the events that preceded them. As a former employee of the DMH, I believe James White created a hostile work environment for several Black/African American employees of the DMH (FSH). As a former employee of the DMH, I believe the manner in which the physical aggressions of James White were being logged on his progress reports were problematic. As a former employee of the DMH, I believe progress reports detailing the physical aggressions of James White should be reviewed. As a former employee of the DMH, I believe the progress reports detailing the physical aggressions of James White should be consistent with the audio and video footage within the possession of the FSH documenting James White physical aggression. As a former employee of the FSH, I was vocally discouraged to log into the medical chart of James White his physical aggressions by staff who would say: “I got this.” As a former employee of the FSH, I was witness to the strangest things which (in my opinion) bordered the bizarre. I would like to take this opportunity to cite just one example to illustrate my point. After I had become a float employee of the FSH, I was assigned on a non-negligible basis to the New Outlook Program (NOP) of the FSH. While working the night shift, I was witness there to several physical altercations between patients amongst themselves and with staff. On such occasions, the rules and regulations of the FSH require that staff press on the keys provided to them to call on Staff Support. {Anytime Staff Support is called, a Registered Nurse (R.N) and/or a Licensed Practitioner Nurse (LPN) is required to be present on the ward.} On one evening I was working at the NOP, STAFF SUPPORT was called because of a physical altercation in the day-room. The staff monitoring the day-room was a Caucasian woman who (like myself) was assigned the title of Forensic Rehab Specialist (FRS). She was the closest person to the physical altercation and had been working at the FSH for several years. When the R.N came to ask her what happened, her response was: “I DON’T KNOW ANYTHING!” As a former employee of the FSH, I didn’t believe she was in any way whatsoever the cause of the physical altercation. However, I found her response telling of certain practices at the FSH, which in my opinion merit reflection. I encourage you to think about the response of this Caucasian woman to a physical altercation she was the closest to witness. Take care. W (AACL) - MICHAEL A.

W (AACL) - MICHAEL A. AYELE 4 FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA) REQUEST 3) Request for a Fee Waiver and Expedited Processing The requested records have posed an imminent threat to the lives and physical safety of people, who have been employed for the Missouri Department of Mental Health (DMH) Fulton State Hospital (FSH) located 600 East 5th Street, Fulton, Missouri; 65251. A nonnegligible number of patients in the Fulton State Hospital are individuals who have pled not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI). A considerable number of patients of the FSH have also been transferred from lower security settings facilities outside of the Fulton, Missouri area because of the danger they pose. I had 8 years ago read as a covered entity of the FSH the personal health information (PHI) of patients/prisoners thereof. I had become in my former capacity as a Forensic Rehab Specialist (FRS) familiar with several aspects of their medical history. The Missouri Secretary of State has previously described FSH as a “mental asylum.” iv Several law firms v and news outlets vi in the State of Missouri, who are familiar with working conditions there have gone on to rank it as one the most dangerous places to work in. On the bases I have mentioned above, I believe this records request should be expedited and all fees waived. In my opinion, the records I have requested to be promptly disclosed (1) have put into question the government’s integrity and adversely impacted public confidence about the manner in which women and racial minorities are treated in the United States of America (USA); (2) have identified operations and activities of the federal government in concert with U.S local and state government; (3) are meaningfully informative about government operations or activities in order to be ‘likely to contribute’ to and increase public understanding of those operations or activities. The Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Information Policy (OIP) defines a “perfected” FOIA request as a request for records which adequately describes the records sought, that has been received by the FOIA office of the agency or agency component in possession of the records, and for which there is no remaining question about the payment of applicable fees.vii The Association for the Advancement of Civil Liberties (AACL) is a non-governmental organization (NGO).

The AACL also requests a waiver of search fees on the grounds that the AACL qualifies as a “representative of the news media” and the records are not sought for commercial use. 5 U.S.C § 552(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II).

Michael Ayele (W),"I am writing this letter to file a FOIA request for records with your offices. The basis for this request for records are the recently disclosed records from the Missouri Department of Mental Health (DMH) dealing with (1) the cultural diversity training they provide to their employees and (2) the policy and procedure for the use of electronic surveillance, recordings, and photography to “insure safety, quality of care, and other purposes such as recreation, media, etc.” The recently disclosed records from the DMH have been hereby attached in Appendix A. 1) Background Via e-mail dated Saturday June 26th 2021, I requested for the DMH to promptly disclose records within their possession detailing (1) documents outlining the retention policy of the DMH (FSH) pertaining to audio/video footage documenting physical aggressions by patients/prisoners against a staff member of the DMH (FSH); (2) documents outlining the academic backgrounds, the annual salaries, the professional roles/responsibilities of people at the DMH (FSH), who are responsible for processing injury claims filed by a staff member of the FSH as a direct consequence of a physical aggression they may have been subjected to; (3) documents outlining the training provided by the DMH (FSH) to prevent physical aggressions on the basis of non-meritorious factors such as race, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, religious affiliation and other attributes people may associate themselves with; (4) their communications in the form of e-mails and postal correspondence about the hostile environment created by the former-president ever since Lehigh University decided to grant him an honorary degree two-years following the rape and murder of Jeanne Ann Clery in 1986; (5) their communications in the form of e-mails and postal correspondence about the origin of COVID-19; (6) their communications in the form of e-mails and postal correspondence about the World Health Organization (WHO) report suggesting that COVID- 19 came from bats; (7) President Biden order requiring intelligence agencies of the U.S.A to look into the origins of COVID-19. Via e-mail dated July 13th 2021, the DMH provided records they deemed responsive to my June 26th 2021 request. As previously mentioned, those records disclosed by the DMH have been hereby attached in Appendix A. In the e-mail I had sent the DMH, I had expressed concerns about their failure to promptly disclose records within their possession pertaining to (1) patient/prisoner James White using the N-word and physically charging at me; (2) patient/prisoner James White using the N-word in reference to other staff members of the Fulton State Hospital (FSH), who were assigned to the Program for Recovery Initiation and Self-Motivation (PRISM) at the time I was a public employee regularly assigned to that program; (3) patient/prisoner James White using the N-word in reference to patients of the Biggs Forensic Center (BFC) PRISM; (4) patient/prisoner James White targeting patients, W (AACL) - MICHAEL A. AYELE 2 FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOIA) REQUEST who were Blacks/African Americans to physically attack them. As of this writing, the DMH do not deny that (1) since the moment of his arrival as a patient/prisoner at the FSH (BFC), James White began referring to me as a “N*****;” (2) James White referred to other Blacks/African American staff regularly assigned to the PRISM as “N******;” (3) James White referred to other Blacks/African American patients/prisoners of the FSH (BFC) as “N******;” (4) I had separated a physical altercation involving James White and a Black/African patient/prisoner whose name was Claudel after James White physically attacked Claudel in the day-room of the PRISM after having called him a “N*****;” (5) James White at a later date following his altercation with patient/prisoner Claudel physically attacked me after having called me a “N*****;” (6) I became a float employee no longer routinely assigned to the PRISM after I had separated a physical attack of James White directed at Claudel; (7) I became a float employee no longer routinely assigned to the PRISM after having vocally objected to being called a “N*****;” (8) I became a float employee no longer routinely assigned to the PRISM after having been vocally discouraged to report James White abusive behavior and the manner it was being logged on his Personal Health Information (PHI). As a former employee of the DMH, I regret the decision of the FSH not to promptly disclose audio and video footage of James White physical aggression and the events that preceded them. As a former employee of the DMH, I believe James White created a hostile work environment for several Black/African American employees of the DMH (FSH). As a former employee of the DMH, I believe the manner in which the physical aggressions of James White were being logged on his progress reports were problematic. As a former employee of the DMH, I believe progress reports detailing the physical aggressions of James White should be reviewed.

The AACL also requests a waiver of search fees on the grounds that the AACL qualifies as a W (AACL) - MICHAEL A.

City of Baltimore v Burke? Project on Military Procurement v Dept of Navy? The AACL is not filing this request to further its commercial interest. As previously mentioned, any information disclosed by the AACL as a result of this request for records will be available to the public at no cost.

Sam Stecklow,"I am a journalist and researcher working on a report for the Chicago Independent Media Alliance (CIMA), a coalition of local ethnic and community media outlets in the Chicagoland area that is housed within the Chicago Reader. This report is looking into how local units of government in Chicago and Cook County spend advertising money, and which media outlets receive ad buys from different units of government. This project is inspired by and based on one conducted by the Center for Community Media at the City University of New York for New York City government.

As I approach finalizing this report, I am providing each of the units of government the opportunity to review my analysis of the information provided so that input and feedback can be provided. If DPS would not like to take advantage of this opportunity, please just let me know and I will move forward with the information I have.

Part of the work that I did once I received DPS's data was to code each media outlet that had received an ad buy as either ""Major,"" ""Ethnic/Community,"" or ""Other."" For the purposes of this project, a national or international outlet that serves a particular ethnic minority was not considered an ""Ethnic/Community"" outlet, because the focus of this project is on purchases with local outlets in Chicagoland. Some examples of a national ethnic media outlet would be Univision or the Sing Tao Press, which are both owned by multinational corporations, despite serving local ethnic minorities. If DPS disagrees with the coding of any particular media outlet, please let me know and we can discuss.",2021-05-19T00:00:00.000,2021-05-26T00:00:00.000,Chicago Reader

Tyehimba Turner,"I am contacting you for a few reasons:

We were aware of the online contract lookup tool that you shared but found that it was very limiting. We conducted citywide searches over multiple years and did not find any instances of the city purchasing apparel in the last five years. Of course, we don't have contract numbers, which also complicates matters. 

Additionally, one of my requests was denied as unduly burdensome. Your understanding of our request was correct. We were hoping that the City had this information handy so that we could understand what percentage of DPS funding goes towards procuring actual items (in which child labor may be used in the supply chain) as opposed to services (which we would reasonably expect child labor not to exist in.) However, we can back off that request as it was tangential.

Finally, to clarify my previous request I will submit one additional request seeking: 

1.	The number of affidavits collected under the Sweatshop Free Procurement Act in FY15-19 (separated by year)
2.	The number of contracts entered by the City that would fall under the Sweatshop Free Procurement Act's scope in FY15-19 (also stated as the number of contracts related to apparel in FY15-19, separated by year).

Tyehimba Turner,"I am contacting you with the following intent:

1.	Requesting clarification of a recent FOIA request in which your office stated that it “neither possess nor maintains” responsive records.
2.	Providing clarification and narrowly tailoring request #3 (listed below), which was denied as “unduly burdensome,” per statute.

It is my understanding that the Department of Procurement Services is responsible for abiding by 2-92-605 of the Municipal Code of Chicago (also known as Regulations for Sweatshop-Free Procurement) and that these regulations apply to “contracts awarded by the City for purchasing garments.” Under these regulations, contractors must “complete an affidavit verifying that neither they nor any of their subcontractors, in the performance of their contracts, shall engage or otherwise utilize any supply chain that uses sweatshop labor.”

My prior request asked for disclosure of the following. In red, I have listed the following conclusions that I have drawn from your response and want to confirm that your response of “no responsive documents” is accurate.

1.	The number of audits conducted under 2-92-605 of the Municipal Code of 	Chicago also known as Regulations for Sweatshop-Free Procurement. 

DPS has not conducted any audits under 2-92-605 and/or does not have records of such audits.

2.	The precise dollar amount of apparel items/garments (as defined by Regulations for Sweatshop-Free Procurement) procured by the City of Chicago in FY15-19 (separated by year)

The City of Chicago has not entered any procurement contracts for garments between FY15-19 or DPS has no records of such contracts (e.g. DPS has not collected the required affidavit for garment contractors and is thus unable to quantify the annual dollar amount of contracts which required these affidavits to be signed in each requested fiscal year.) 

3.	A list of companies that supplied apparel items/garments (as defined by      Regulations for Sweatshop-Free Procurement) to the City of Chicago in FY17-18, if available. (separated by year)

Similar to the previous request, it would seem that DPS would be able to determine the identity of companies supplying the City with garments by reviewing saved affidavits within the requested fiscal years. Your reply of “no responsive documents” would suggest that this information does not exist within the Department of Procurement Services (including the required affidavits.)



Clarification of Request #3:

It is my understanding that the Department of Procurement Services (DPS) is funded on an annual basis and expends a percentage of those funds to procure both goods and services for the city of Chicago. 

Request #3 (see below) seeks the disclosure of the (non-itemized) dollar amount of goods (not services) procured by the City via DPS in fiscal years 15-19.

The precise dollar amount of all items procured by the City of Chicago in FY15-19 (separated by year)


Thus, I would like to revise my request to state the following:

The precise dollar amount of DPS budget expended to procure goods (not services)    for the City of Chicago in each fiscal year, FY15-19.",2020-12-12T00:00:00.000,2020-12-09T00:00:00.000,UNICEF USA

Vince Davis,"Over the pasted 30 years, I have made many attempts to expose and prove that there are plethora of collusion and fraudulent concealment within the Chicago Police Department, Department Procurement Services, and the City of Chicago Law Office. However, no one would listen to my concerns which later affected my family and many other families that were under the auspicious of the Department of Children Family Services (DCFS).
Needless to say, I can’t do any of this work without your help. It has been a long battle back since I terminated as a Chicago Police Officer. I will present to you evidence that crimes were committed within the police departments and other departments. The crimes committed against me and the citizens of Chicago will shock the conscience. There was a proposed resolution in 1995 directing the Committee on Police and Fire to hold hearings to ascertain whether Tox- Tech Laboratory was contracted to test my one urine sample given at the medical section. The committee determined and agreed upon that Tox-Tech created a fraudulent licensed under the United States Department of Health and Human Service. A resolution was enter because the laboratory was not approved by the Director of personnel Commander Hubert Holton to conduct such testing. At this present time, l am asking the Superintendent of Police to declare invalid any test resulted from Tox Tech Laboratory. William Beavers held a resolution in the Police and Fire Committee, which prevented the resolution from being passed by City Council committee. Subsequently, Tox-Tech was convicted in the Circuit Court of Cook County of Illinois. Furthermore, investigation revealed through a conversation from a representative from the Office of Clerk who related that all contracts are archived at the Clerk’s Office, and if a contract is not archive, this is proves that the City did not approved a contract with Tox-Tech Laboratory. Furthermore, Tox-Tech fraudulent contract is nowhere to be found in neither the Department of Procurement nor the Clerk's Office. (See attached fraud contract mailed through USPS).
Illinois Courts held that judgment obtained by fraud is void ab initio and can be attacked at any Court and at any time. A judge is an officer of the court, as well as all attorneys. A state judge is a state judicial officer, paid by the State to act impartially and lawfully. A federal or state judicial officer, paid by government entity must act impartially and lawfully. State and federal attorneys fall into the same general category and must meet the same requirements.  People v. Zajic , 88 Ill.App.3d 477, 410 N.E.2d 626 (1980). Based on the facts, whenever any officer of the court commits fraud during a proceeding in the court, he/she is engaged in “fraud upon the court”. In Bulloch v. United States, 763 F.2d 1115, 1121 (10th Cir. 1985), the court stated “Fraud upon the court is fraud which is directed to the judicial machinery itself and is not fraud between the parties or fraudulent documents, false statements or perjury. Please review the attached memorandum and fraudulent contract along with several fictitious certifications from the federal government.
In 1990, I was an active paying union member when FOP Lodge 7 refused to represent me at the Chicago Police Board hearing. I was without legal representation at the hearing. Recently, I requested assistance in this matter from the National Labor Relation Act because FOP owed a duty of fair representation to me. I request your office to correspond in a letter or by email stating that Tox-Tech never received a contract from the procurement department, and this request is under the Freedom of Information Act because the City of Chicago and Fraternal Order of Police failed to adequately protect me as an employee and as a union member.  
Further, a fraudulent contract was mailed through the USPS to my previous address at 8542 South Loomis along with a forged signature of previous mayor Richard M. Daley and fraudulent federal certifications. See attached fraud contract. The aforementioned crimes are one of the biggest cover up within the police department and procurement services. Recently, I discover the procurement department and Clerk’s Office are bound by law to expose procurement fraud and other crimes that were committed by City’s employees.  I also seek civil penalties, penalties under the Illinois Criminal Statue penalties under Deceptive Business Practices Act, and penalties under the Chicago Municipal Code. I look forward to hearing from you or your staff soon as possible.

•	The question before us is to decide whether Corporation Counsel John Kavanaugh is liable under fraud upon the court?
•	The question before us is to decide whether the procurement department mailed a fraudulent contract and fraudulent federal certification through USPS?  
•	The question before us is whether the Police and Fire Committee introduced a resolution in the City Council of allegations of police testing by an unauthorized laboratory?
•	The question before us is whether Chicago City Council passed legislation related to a bid proposal between 1988-1990 of KK. Bio Science and Tox Tech Laboratories?
•	The question before us is whether prior Mayor Richard Daley’s signature was forged located on the last page and without having a date signed?

STATEMENT OF FACTS

On March 31, 1990, former Chicago Police Officer Vince Davis (Star No. 15672, Emp. No. 174470) was injured while on duty. Davis’ injuries were documented. On April 20,1990, Davis arrived without being scheduled at the medical section to get an extension on his medical leave and at which time Davis was instructed by Sgt. Thomas Reese (Star No. 804, Emp. No.678649) to complete a physical at 8:45 a.m. to determine whether (Davis) was capable of performing required duties or essential functions. The physical consisted of a cardiograph, blood sample, and two urine samples; one urine sample was placed on a counter (unsecured), and the other was placed in a refrigerator. Davis was directed by Marilyn Markham to leave the room. 
On April 25, 1990, Davis’s one urine samples was picked up by  Detective George 

Brown and transported five days later to K.K. Bio Science/Tox-Tech a fraudulent drug testing 

laboratory located at 10 W. 35th Street, Chicago, IL 60616, owned and operated by Krishan 

Kaistha and Anita Mahajan, President. Two weeks later after Davis’s physical, Internal Affairs 

arrived at the 2nd District to inform Davis’s assigned district that his urinalysis results were 

positive for an unnamed metabolite drug. However, Davis’s blood specimen was also tested, 

and the results were negative for drugs. Davis has always proclaimed his innocence and now 

he will provide proof of fraud upon the court during his administrative hearing and prior court 

proceedings.

The Fraternal Order of Police refused to provide representation for Davis at his hearing, which was a direct violation of the “Collective Bargaining Agreement.” On October 3, 1990, Davis was terminated by the Chicago Police Department as a result of the fraudulent physical given at the medical section. The blood specimen that was tested, which was negative, was never considered, and the second urine sample was never tested against the sample that rendered a positive result because the second sample was discarded. See Attached Blood Test. Davis filed an administrative review in the Circuit Court of Cook County. The Court found no evidence on record that an initial hearing was held in Davis’s case within 30 days after being served, therefore the Police Board did not have jurisdiction. Summary Judgment was granted, and the decision of the Police Board was reversed. Davis’s case was remanded to the Police Board with instructions to reinstate him back into his position as a Chicago Police Officer. See Circuit Court of Cook County Order 90CH11020. The City filed an appeal at the Appellate Court level. Davis’s reinstatement was reversed because Superintendent Leroy Martin was not named as one of the defendants. See Davis v Chicago Police Board 645 N.E. 2ND 274 (1994). 
Davis contacted State’s Attorney Office of Dick Devine under file number 99-90 to initiate an investigation for possible criminal prosecution of K.K. Bio Science and Tox Tech. His office suggested that Davis file a small claim in the Circuit Court of Cook County. Davis contacted various criminal justice agencies and government officials from 1990 to 2016, which had negative results for assistance.  A letter dated June 27, 1995 from United States Senator Paul Simon corresponded to Superintendent Matt Rodriguez reads: Dear Superintendent, I received the enclosed correspondence from my constituent, Mr. Vince Davis, concerning the termination of his employment. For a more detailed explanation, please review the attached information. Mr. Davis maintains that the laboratory Tox-Tech was not licensed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service to conduct a drug test. If Mr. Davis is correct, the test results would appear to be invalid. Signed Senator Paul Simon. See Attached Letter.
               On July 21, 1995, the City of Chicago Police and Fire Commission held a hearing to investigate K.K. Bio Science and Tox -Tech Inc. in regard to the police department’s drug testing practices of its employees. The resolutions are as follows: WHEREAS, the administration of routine drug test Chicago Police Department employees is being carried out—in part, at least, by a laboratory known as Tox-Tech; and WHEREAS, it has come to the attention of some officials that Tox-Tech is not licensed by the United States Department of Health and Human Services to conduct such drug testing, and therefore test results appear to be invalid; NOW, 
Therefore, be it resolved that the City Council Committee on Police and Fire Commission held immediate hearing into charges that Tox-Tech is not licensed by the U.S. Department of Health to conduct drug testing, and if not, that the committee then investigate the hiring of Tox-Tech and memorialize the Superintendent of the Police to declare invalid any results from Tox-Tech testing and to contract with a duly licensed laboratory for the drug testing of its department employees, Signed Alderman Jones 15th Ward. Alderman William Beavers held Davis’s resolution in the committee to prevent the resolution from being passed because additional evidence was discovered by the Committee that a nurse assigned to the medical section was caught switching urine samples. See Attached Resolution City Council Committee on Police and Fire Commission.
In 2007, Anita Mahajan, a representative of K.K. Bio Science and Tox Tech was arrested on an indictment to fraudulently bill the state for drug testing work that was never performed. This indictment took place in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois under 07-CR-09839. Davis contacted the State’s Attorney Office under Dick Devine and Anita Alverez both refused to
discuss Davis’s issues and pertinent documents which show a history of corruption by Mahajan and the City of Chicago. Thereafter, Anita Mahajan pled guilty to a Class 4 felony for submitting fraudulent billing for drug detection of clients of the Illinois Department of Children Family Service.  From January 2004 until November 2006 Anita Mahajan failed to perform services for the Department of Children Family Services. With the conviction of Anita Mahajan, Davis discovered documents needed to prove fraud upon the court by the Corporation Council of the City of Chicago. Davis lost his administrative hearing due to several acts of fraud upon the court. See People of the State of Illinois v. Anta Mahajan. 
DISCUSSION

On July 1990, Davis appeared before the police board under administrative charges by the City of Chicago Corporation Counsel and Chicago Police Department. John Kavanaugh the 
corporation counsel attorney represented the Chicago Police Department on behalf of false allegations which lead to fraud upon the court and the wrongful discharge of Vince Davis as a police officer. Davis’s charges were as follows: failed to take admission test and failed a drug testing urinalysis and a complete physical. Kavanaugh presented to the board a fraudulent and fictitious drug testing contract that was not approved by the City Council. All procurement contracts are signed and approved by the Mayor, City Council, and the Corporation Council. The Contract Administrative Negotiator Alicia Garcia- Abner knowingly and willfully created and signed a fraudulent contract which resulted in Davis’s termination as a Chicago Police Officer.  
To prosecute Abner successfully under the State, the State must prove that she knowingly and without authority made a false statement of a material fact to the city in violation of any statute, ordinance or regulation, or who knowingly falsified any statement of a material fact made in connection with an application, report, affidavit, oath or attestation, including a statement of material facts made in connection with a bid, proposal, rigging contract or economic disclosure statement is in violation of Chapter 1-21, Chapter 1-22, Chapter 1-22-020 False Claim Act. 
It is undeniable that Alicia Garcia- Abner knowingly signed a fraudulent contract 

without authority because she was the negotiator of the contract which resulted in Davis’s 

termination. The general statement of the discovery rule is that fraud statute of limitations 

begins to run when the cause of action is discovered or by the exercise of reasonable diligence 

should have been discovered. Kavanagh knowingly, willfully and without authority testified and 

presented fraudulent documents to the court to have Davis terminated as a Chicago Police 

Officer. Davis’s transcript reflects John Kavanagh’s cross examination of Krishan Kiastha the 

owner of the fictitious company who testified that his company was under the federal authority of 

Department Health and Human Services. However, they were not under the authority nor 

certified by DHHS. Fraud includes anything calculated to deceive, whether it be a single act or 

combination of circumstances, whether the suppression of truth or the suggestion of what is 

false, whether it be by direct falsehood or by innuendo,by speech or by silence, by word of 

mouth or by look or gesture. See People ex rel. Chicago Bar Association v. Gilmore (1931), 345 

Ill. 28, 46, 177 N.E. 710; In re Armentrout (1983),99ll, 75 Ill. Dec. 703, 457 N.E. 2nd 1262.

The basic elements of fraud and deceit are: (1) a false representation of a material fact; (2) the defendant must know of the falsity but, nevertheless, makes the statement for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to rely on it; (3) the plaintiff must justifiably rely on the statement; and (4) the plaintiff must have suffered damages as a consequence. Burkhart v. Alison Realty Trust (N.D.Ill. 1973), 363 F. Supp. 1286, 1291.  Commander Hubert Holton of personnel division corresponded with Krishan Kaistha dated September 7, 1988. Dear Dr., Kaistha, tabulation of bids has been received by the Department relating to the contract for Urinalysis Testing. We reviewed Tox-Tech’s proposal revealed incompleteness in specifications. You must provide documentation of license with United States Department of Health and Human Service, expired July 1, 1988. Please provide the required response and documents to Ms. Alicia Garcia Purchasing Department. 
The documents and certifications submitted to Commander Hubert Holton were fraudulent. Davis received numerous letters from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and government agencies stating that Tox-Tech and KK. Bio Science never had certification. A letter dated December 9, 1994, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Donna M.  Bush, Ph. D: “Dear Mr. Davis: Tox-Tech, 10 West 35th Street, Chicago, Illinois has never been a certified laboratory and was not a certified laboratory in April 1990”.  Davis ascertained a copy of the fictitious and fraudulent contact dated April 26,1995, which was sent by mailed to 8542 South Loomis Chicago, Illinois 60620.  Law Office Kent R. Brody corresponded in a letter dated September 8, 1992, to Donna M. Bush of the United States Department of Health and Human Service that Kaistha and Tox Tech, Inc. regret Davis’s circumstances that occurred. A reasonable person would have believed that this statement is an apology of wrongdoing.
Thereafter, Donna M. Bush corresponded in a letter dated September 14, 1992, to Kent R. Brody that Tox-Tech cannot proceed with certification process that started in 1992.  Here, K.K. Bio Science/Tox-Tech Inc. reported to Commander Hubert Holton that they were licensed and certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. They were not certified. See All Correspondences Attached.  All documents and testimonies submitted as evidence to the Police Board were fraudulent documents.  Kavanagh’s conduct was engaged in an effort to keep secret inside the City of Chicago Corporation Counsel Department and the willfulness of the fraud upon the court. Attached to the fictitious contract are two fraudulent DHHS Certifications. At the very top of the fictitious certification is affixed with United States Seal. See 18 U.S Code 1017. Government Seal Wrongfully Use.  The fraudulent contract has a forged signature of Mayor Richard M. Daley located at the last page approval cycle. See fraudulent contract dated April 26, 1995.  
This memorandum addresses whether fraud upon the court actually played a factor in Davis’s termination as a Chicago Police Officer and the answer is, “Yes.” When determining whether fraud upon the court occurred, the court evaluates how the alleged misconduct affected the integrity of the judicial process, either because the court itself was defrauded or because the misconduct was perpetrated by officers of the court. See Alexander v. Robertson, 882 F.2d 421,424 (9th Cir. 1989). Here, Kavanagh knowingly and willfully deceived the Judge by presenting fraudulent exhibits to the court. It is clear and evident that fraud and tricks were used to prevent Davis from having a fair hearing.
Whenever any officer of the court as defined by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to embrace that species in fraud upon the court. In Bullock v. United States, 763F2d 1115, 1121(10th Cir 1985), the court stated “Fraud upon the court which is directed to the machinery itself and is not fraud between the parties or fraudulent documents, false statements or perjury. It is where the court or court member is corrupted”. This also clearly and well settled that in Illinois law any attempt to commit fraud upon the court vitiates or spoils the entire proceeding. See People of the State of Illinois v Fred E. Sterling, 357, lll. 354; 1922 N.E. 229(1934) (“The maxim that fraud vitiates every transaction into enters) In re Village of Willowbrook, 37 lll. App.393(1962) (Its axiomatic or evident that fraud vitiate everything.) Dunham, 57 lll. App. 475 (1894), affirmed 162 lll. 589 (1896); Skelly Oil Co. v Universal Oil Product Co., 338 lll. App. 79, 86 N.E. 2ND 875, 883-4 (1949); See Thomas Stasel v. The American Home Security Corporation, 362 lll. 350; 199 N.E. 798 (1935). 
There is also newly discovered evidence from March 3, 2013 from the Clerk’s Office, which reads as follows: As per our email correspondence, this in regard to your question about Tox-Tech Laboratory, Chicago having business that required the Chicago City Council to pass related to a bid proposal between 1988-1990. What I did was to do a keyword search for Tox-Tech in an electronic version of each volume of the Journal of proceedings for those years. The searching results in no reference to this company. Signed Elizabeth Wittman. On October 5, 2010, Davis contacted the Procurement Department under the Freedom of Information Act, which reads as follows: Dear Mr. Davis, on the behalf of the Department of Procurement Services, I am responding to your request dated September 21, 2010, for the following documents. Contract specification 70-88-340 copy of Tox-Tech and KK Bioscience contract for Urinalysis for Drug Detection contract number 73070 and the specification number 1990-643. After a thorough search of our records, I must inform you that DPS has been unable to locate any record in the files. Signed Shannon Andrews. See Correspondences Attached. 
Davis has substantial evidence that fraud existed with conspiracy to cover up a crime. See In ROCHIN V. California, 342U.S.165, 72s. Ct.205, 96 L. Ed. 183 (1952). Davis contacted the Secretary of State’s Corporation file under 5431470 and it was discovered that K.K. Bio Science had dissolved on July 16, 1986, and the detail report states that Tox-Tech did not exist as a legal corporation in the State of Illinois. Never, under any circumstances, are the procedures that were followed during the collection and testing of Davis’ specimen “normal.” According to Personnel Division Chain of Custody, “turn-around time for test results from an original specimen shall not exceed (24) twenty-four hours for the initial screening, and (48) forty-eight hours on confirmation test results.” Clearly, the chain of custody was broken. Furthermore, Personnel Division specifications for urine analysis states that, “the pick-up of specimens will be the responsibility of Tox-Tech.” Such was not the case in Davis’ situation. 
Two urine samples were collected April 20, 1990, one stayed on the countertop without being secured and one was transported five and a half days later on April 25, 1990, not by a Tox-Tech courier, but by a police officer, George Brown. It remains a mystery why the second urine specimen that Davis provided not tested?  Procedures for the second sample are clearly stated in the General Orders and Personnel Department. During Davis’ court hearing with the Chicago Police Board, he was not allowed to check the second urine sample to determine through DNA testing whether the first urine sample that resulted in a positive hit for the metabolite was his. Only the one urine sample was used to test for drugs. See Police Board Transcript.  
According to the Personnel Division General Orders and specifications, all samples confirmed positive will be stored for five years. Unfortunately, no samples were saved or stored for further testing; there is no record of the second specimen ever being tested and no record of what happened to the second specimen. Here, the Personnel Division City Council never approved Tox-Tech to perform any drug testing because the license provided was fraudulent and the bid specifications were not met according to Commander Hubert W. Holton’s correspondence letter which was sent to Krishan Kaistha. See City of Chicago Personnel Division Correspondence Letter.  KK Bioscience defrauded the taxpayers of more than $674, 008.61. Tox Tech defrauded the taxpayer of more than $518,973.15. See Attached Department of Finance report.
CONCLUSION

Under Illinois and Federal law, when any officer of the court has committed a fraud upon the court, all orders and judgment of that court are void, and of no legal force or effect. The decision of the administrative board is void and any other orders are void.  However, based upon the aforementioned facts and rule of law, the City of Chicago Corporation Counsel is obligated to restore Vince Davis back to his position as a police officer. Davis has continued to suffer financially without employment due to the fraud perpetrated by the Chicago Police Department, Department Procurement Services and Corporation Counsel which resulted in his termination of employment and defamation of character from April 1990 to the present. This entire incident shocks the conscious.",2020-08-29T00:00:00.000,2020-09-08T00:00:00.000,
Vince Davis,"Over the pasted 30 years, I have made many attempts to expose and prove that there are plethora of collusion and fraudulent concealment within the Chicago Police Department, Department Procurement Services, and the City of Chicago Law Office. However, no one would listen to my concerns which later affected my family and many other families that were under the auspicious of the Department of Children Family Services (DCFS).
Needless to say, I can’t do any of this work without your help. It has been a long battle back since I terminated as a Chicago Police Officer. I will present to you evidence that crimes were committed within the police departments and other departments. The crimes committed against me and the citizens of Chicago will shock the conscience. There was a proposed resolution in 1995 directing the Committee on Police and Fire to hold hearings to ascertain whether Tox- Tech Laboratory was contracted to test my one urine sample given at the medical section. The committee determined and agreed upon that Tox-Tech created a fraudulent licensed under the United States Department of Health and Human Service. A resolution was enter because the laboratory was not approved by the Director of personnel Commander Hubert Holton to conduct such testing. At this present time, l am asking the Superintendent of Police to declare invalid any test resulted from Tox Tech Laboratory. William Beavers held a resolution in the Police and Fire Committee, which prevented the resolution from being passed by City Council committee. Subsequently, Tox-Tech was convicted in the Circuit Court of Cook County of Illinois. Furthermore, investigation revealed through a conversation from a representative from the Office of Clerk who related that all contracts are archived at the Clerk’s Office, and if a contract is not archive, this is proves that the City did not approved a contract with Tox-Tech Laboratory. Furthermore, Tox-Tech fraudulent contract is nowhere to be found in neither the Department of Procurement nor the Clerk's Office. (See attached fraud contract mailed through USPS).
Illinois Courts held that judgment obtained by fraud is void ab initio and can be attacked at any Court and at any time. A judge is an officer of the court, as well as all attorneys. A state judge is a state judicial officer, paid by the State to act impartially and lawfully. A federal or state judicial officer, paid by government entity must act impartially and lawfully. State and federal attorneys fall into the same general category and must meet the same requirements.  People v. Zajic , 88 Ill.App.3d 477, 410 N.E.2d 626 (1980). Based on the facts, whenever any officer of the court commits fraud during a proceeding in the court, he/she is engaged in “fraud upon the court”. In Bulloch v. United States, 763 F.2d 1115, 1121 (10th Cir. 1985), the court stated “Fraud upon the court is fraud which is directed to the judicial machinery itself and is not fraud between the parties or fraudulent documents, false statements or perjury. Please review the attached memorandum and fraudulent contract along with several fictitious certifications from the federal government.
In 1990, I was an active paying union member when FOP Lodge 7 refused to represent me at the Chicago Police Board hearing. I was without legal representation at the hearing. Recently, I requested assistance in this matter from the National Labor Relation Act because FOP owed a duty of fair representation to me. I request your office to correspond in a letter or by email stating that Tox-Tech never received a contract from the procurement department, and this request is under the Freedom of Information Act because the City of Chicago and Fraternal Order of Police failed to adequately protect me as an employee and as a union member.  
Further, a fraudulent contract was mailed through the USPS to my previous address at 8542 South Loomis along with a forged signature of previous mayor Richard M. Daley and fraudulent federal certifications. See attached fraud contract. The aforementioned crimes are one of the biggest cover up within the police department and procurement services. Recently, I discover the procurement department and Clerk’s Office are bound by law to expose procurement fraud and other crimes that were committed by City’s employees.  I also seek civil penalties, penalties under the Illinois Criminal Statue penalties under Deceptive Business Practices Act, and penalties under the Chicago Municipal Code. I look forward to hearing from you or your staff soon as possible.

false, whether it be by direct falsehood or by innuendo,by speech or by silence, by word of 

mouth or by look or gesture. See People ex rel. Chicago Bar Association v. Gilmore (1931), 345 

Ill. 28, 46, 177 N.E. 710; In re Armentrout (1983),99ll, 75 Ill. Dec. 703, 457 N.E. 2nd 1262.

The basic elements of fraud and deceit are: (1) a false representation of a material fact; (2) the defendant must know of the falsity but, nevertheless, makes the statement for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to rely on it; (3) the plaintiff must justifiably rely on the statement; and (4) the plaintiff must have suffered damages as a consequence. Burkhart v. Alison Realty Trust (N.D.Ill. 1973), 363 F. Supp. 1286, 1291.  Commander Hubert Holton of personnel division corresponded with Krishan Kaistha dated September 7, 1988. Dear Dr., Kaistha, tabulation of bids has been received by the Department relating to the contract for Urinalysis Testing. We reviewed Tox-Tech’s proposal revealed incompleteness in specifications. You must provide documentation of license with United States Department of Health and Human Service, expired July 1, 1988. Please provide the required response and documents to Ms. Alicia Garcia Purchasing Department. 
The documents and certifications submitted to Commander Hubert Holton were fraudulent. Davis received numerous letters from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and government agencies stating that Tox-Tech and KK. Bio Science never had certification. A letter dated December 9, 1994, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Donna M.  Bush, Ph. D: “Dear Mr. Davis: Tox-Tech, 10 West 35th Street, Chicago, Illinois has never been a certified laboratory and was not a certified laboratory in April 1990”.  Davis ascertained a copy of the fictitious and fraudulent contact dated April 26,1995, which was sent by mailed to 8542 South Loomis Chicago, Illinois 60620.  Law Office Kent R. Brody corresponded in a letter dated September 8, 1992, to Donna M. Bush of the United States Department of Health and Human Service that Kaistha and Tox Tech, Inc. regret Davis’s circumstances that occurred. A reasonable person would have believed that this statement is an apology of wrongdoing.
Thereafter, Donna M. Bush corresponded in a letter dated September 14, 1992, to Kent R. Brody that Tox-Tech cannot proceed with certification process that started in 1992.  Here, K.K. Bio Science/Tox-Tech Inc. reported to Commander Hubert Holton that they were licensed and certified by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. They were not certified. See All Correspondences Attached.  All documents and testimonies submitted as evidence to the Police Board were fraudulent documents.  Kavanagh’s conduct was engaged in an effort to keep secret inside the City of Chicago Corporation Counsel Department and the willfulness of the fraud upon the court. Attached to the fictitious contract are two fraudulent DHHS Certifications. At the very top of the fictitious certification is affixed with United States Seal. See 18 U.S Code 1017. Government Seal Wrongfully Use.  The fraudulent contract has a forged signature of Mayor Richard M. Daley located at the last page approval cycle. See fraudulent contract dated April 26, 1995.  
This memorandum addresses whether fraud upon the court actually played a factor in Davis’s termination as a Chicago Police Officer and the answer is, “Yes.” When determining whether fraud upon the court occurred, the court evaluates how the alleged misconduct affected the integrity of the judicial process, either because the court itself was defrauded or because the misconduct was perpetrated by officers of the court. See Alexander v. Robertson, 882 F.2d 421,424 (9th Cir. 1989). Here, Kavanagh knowingly and willfully deceived the Judge by presenting fraudulent exhibits to the court. It is clear and evident that fraud and tricks were used to prevent Davis from having a fair hearing.
Whenever any officer of the court as defined by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals to embrace that species in fraud upon the court. In Bullock v. United States, 763F2d 1115, 1121(10th Cir 1985), the court stated “Fraud upon the court which is directed to the machinery itself and is not fraud between the parties or fraudulent documents, false statements or perjury. It is where the court or court member is corrupted”. This also clearly and well settled that in Illinois law any attempt to commit fraud upon the court vitiates or spoils the entire proceeding. See People of the State of Illinois v Fred E. Sterling, 357, lll. 354; 1922 N.E. 229(1934) (“The maxim that fraud vitiates every transaction into enters) In re Village of Willowbrook, 37 lll. App.393(1962) (Its axiomatic or evident that fraud vitiate everything.) Dunham, 57 lll. App. 475 (1894), affirmed 162 lll. 589 (1896); Skelly Oil Co. v Universal Oil Product Co., 338 lll. App. 79, 86 N.E. 2ND 875, 883-4 (1949); See Thomas Stasel v. The American Home Security Corporation, 362 lll. 350; 199 N.E. 798 (1935). 
There is also newly discovered evidence from March 3, 2013 from the Clerk’s Office, which reads as follows: As per our email correspondence, this in regard to your question about Tox-Tech Laboratory, Chicago having business that required the Chicago City Council to pass related to a bid proposal between 1988-1990. What I did was to do a keyword search for Tox-Tech in an electronic version of each volume of the Journal of proceedings for those years. The searching results in no reference to this company. Signed Elizabeth Wittman. On October 5, 2010, Davis contacted the Procurement Department under the Freedom of Information Act, which reads as follows: Dear Mr. Davis, on the behalf of the Department of Procurement Services, I am responding to your request dated September 21, 2010, for the following documents. Contract specification 70-88-340 copy of Tox-Tech and KK Bioscience contract for Urinalysis for Drug Detection contract number 73070 and the specification number 1990-643. After a thorough search of our records, I must inform you that DPS has been unable to locate any record in the files. Signed Shannon Andrews. See Correspondences Attached. 
Davis has substantial evidence that fraud existed with conspiracy to cover up a crime. See In ROCHIN V. California, 342U.S.165, 72s. Ct.205, 96 L. Ed. 183 (1952). Davis contacted the Secretary of State’s Corporation file under 5431470 and it was discovered that K.K. Bio Science had dissolved on July 16, 1986, and the detail report states that Tox-Tech did not exist as a legal corporation in the State of Illinois. Never, under any circumstances, are the procedures that were followed during the collection and testing of Davis’ specimen “normal.” According to Personnel Division Chain of Custody, “turn-around time for test results from an original specimen shall not exceed (24) twenty-four hours for the initial screening, and (48) forty-eight hours on confirmation test results.” Clearly, the chain of custody was broken. Furthermore, Personnel Division specifications for urine analysis states that, “the pick-up of specimens will be the responsibility of Tox-Tech.” Such was not the case in Davis’ situation. 
Two urine samples were collected April 20, 1990, one stayed on the countertop without being secured and one was transported five and a half days later on April 25, 1990, not by a Tox-Tech courier, but by a police officer, George Brown. It remains a mystery why the second urine specimen that Davis provided not tested?  Procedures for the second sample are clearly stated in the General Orders and Personnel Department. During Davis’ court hearing with the Chicago Police Board, he was not allowed to check the second urine sample to determine through DNA testing whether the first urine sample that resulted in a positive hit for the metabolite was his. Only the one urine sample was used to test for drugs. See Police Board Transcript.  
According to the Personnel Division General Orders and specifications, all samples confirmed positive will be stored for five years. Unfortunately, no samples were saved or stored for further testing; there is no record of the second specimen ever being tested and no record of what happened to the second specimen. Here, the Personnel Division City Council never approved Tox-Tech to perform any drug testing because the license provided was fraudulent and the bid specifications were not met according to Commander Hubert W. Holton’s correspondence letter which was sent to Krishan Kaistha. See City of Chicago Personnel Division Correspondence Letter.  KK Bioscience defrauded the taxpayers of more than $674, 008.61. Tox Tech defrauded the taxpayer of more than $518,973.15. See Attached Department of Finance report.
CONCLUSION

Under Illinois and Federal law, when any officer of the court has committed a fraud upon the court, all orders and judgment of that court are void, and of no legal force or effect. The decision of the administrative board is void and any other orders are void.  However, based upon the aforementioned facts and rule of law, the City of Chicago Corporation Counsel is obligated to restore Vince Davis back to his position as a police officer. Davis has continued to suffer financially without employment due to the fraud perpetrated by the Chicago Police Department, Department Procurement Services and Corporation Counsel which resulted in his termination of employment and defamation of character from April 1990 to the present. This entire incident shocks the conscious.",2020-08-29T00:00:00.000,2020-09-08T00:00:00.000,

Michael A. Ayele,"1) Background
According to Senate Congressional record, Carol T. Crawford (then Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice (DOJ)) had reportedly stated that “in the past, the Department of Justice has taken the position that section two of the Fourteenth Amendment … and the original Apportionment and Census Clauses of Article I, section two of the Constitution requires that inhabitants of States who are illegal aliens be included in the census count. In our review of this issue to date, we have found no basis for reversing this position.” In a press release issued by New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, in New York v Department of Commerce, the United States District Court for Southern District of New York consolidated this case with New York Immigration Coalition v Department of Commerce for purposes of that trial and on January 15th 2019 ruled for the plaintiffs on their Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claims and ordered the Commerce Department to remove a citizenship question from the 2020 Census.i In California v Ross, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ruled on March 06th 2019 for the plaintiffs in their Administrative Procedure Act and Enumeration Clause claims and ordered the Commerce Department to remove the citizenship question from the 2020 Census in the following consolidated case: City of San Jose v Ross.ii On July 11th 2019, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 13880 (EO 13880) entitled Collecting Information About Citizenship Status in Connection with the Decennial Census. EO 13880 directs (1) the Department of Commerce (DOC) to “strengthen its efforts, consistent with law, to obtain State administrative records concerning citizenship;” (2) instructs Secretary Ross to create an inter-agency working group to collect citizenship data in connection with the 2020 decennial census for redistricting and (3) demands all federal agencies to provide citizenship data via administrative records to the Census Bureau. Among those federal agencies named in EO 13880 were the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of State, the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). iii EO 13880 mentions the following case: Department of Commerce v New York.iv On September 13th 2019; La Union Del Pueblo Entero, Promise Arizona, Lydia Camarillo and Juanita Valdez Cox filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against Wilbur Ross in his official capacity as U.S Secretary of Commerce and Steven Dillingham in his official capacity as Director of the U.S. Census Bureau.v On July 21st 2020, Donald Trump signed a Memorandum on Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census.vi On July 28th 2020, the Department of Justice

Michael A. Ayele,"1) Background
According to Senate Congressional record, Carol T. Crawford (then Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice (DOJ)) had reportedly stated that “in the past, the Department of Justice has taken the position that section two of the Fourteenth Amendment … and the original Apportionment and Census Clauses of Article I, section two of the Constitution requires that inhabitants of States who are illegal aliens be included in the census count. In our review of this issue to date, we have found no basis for reversing this position.” In a press release issued by New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice, in New York v Department of Commerce, the United States District Court for Southern District of New York consolidated this case with New York Immigration Coalition v Department of Commerce for purposes of that trial and on January 15th 2019 ruled for the plaintiffs on their Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claims and ordered the Commerce Department to remove a citizenship question from the 2020 Census.i In California v Ross, the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ruled on March 06th 2019 for the plaintiffs in their Administrative Procedure Act and Enumeration Clause claims and ordered the Commerce Department to remove the citizenship question from the 2020 Census in the following consolidated case: City of San Jose v Ross.ii On July 11th 2019, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 13880 (EO 13880) entitled Collecting Information About Citizenship Status in Connection with the Decennial Census. EO 13880 directs (1) the Department of Commerce (DOC) to “strengthen its efforts, consistent with law, to obtain State administrative records concerning citizenship;” (2) instructs Secretary Ross to create an inter-agency working group to collect citizenship data in connection with the 2020 decennial census for redistricting and (3) demands all federal agencies to provide citizenship data via administrative records to the Census Bureau. Among those federal agencies named in EO 13880 were the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of State, the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). iii EO 13880 mentions the following case: Department of Commerce v New York.iv On September 13th 2019; La Union Del Pueblo Entero, Promise Arizona, Lydia Camarillo and Juanita Valdez Cox filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against Wilbur Ross in his official capacity as U.S Secretary of Commerce and Steven Dillingham in his official capacity as Director of the U.S. Census Bureau.v On July 21st 2020, Donald Trump signed a Memorandum on Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census.vi On July 28th 2020, the Department of Justice
(DOJ) Attorney General William Barr says before the legislative branch of the U.S Government that Donald Trump July 21st 2020 memo is not unconstitutional. vii
