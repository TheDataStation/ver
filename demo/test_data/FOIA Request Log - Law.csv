Please provide communication, written or electronic, regarding the attached violation notice (19DS57116L) and that whether it has been reviewed by the Law Department. 
  
Background: In 2013, ex-Alderman Pawar said: 
""Every year more and more of our residents and businesses have been planting native plants in their parkways and yards. Native plants (for a description see our webpage) or plants that have evolved in our region are best able to survive drought, disease, pests and climatic conditions. Because are also best at keeping the ground permeable with their deeper root structures and absorbing water, they are nicknamed “rain gardens;” indeed they will be used as part of the Lawrence Streetscape to reduce stormwater flooding at the corners. 

""I am also happy to announce that the Department of Streets and Sanitation (DSS) is taking steps to ensure that property owners who have native gardens on the public way or on their property will not be ticketed for weed violations in the City code. While tickets have never been given to native plantings in the 47th Ward, there are some areas of the city where tickets have been issued erroneously and resulted in major fines to owners of native gardens. Please be aware that DSS will continue to ticket abandoned and uncared for properties, but native gardens that often look very different from traditional lawns and gardens are protected. Also, DSS will now require inspectors to attempt to make contact with property owners before issuing a ticket, and have given them training to identify these gardens. The City’s Law Department will be flagging weed cutting tickets for a second look to ensure no homeowners are ticketed incorrectly for their gardens. 

“A big thank you to Streets and Sanitation Commissioner, Charles Williams, and his team for taking these steps to help ensure that native gardens continue to thrive in our beautiful city. And, as always, thank you to Erick Norton, the 47th Ward Superintendent, and his team, for keeping our neighborhoods so beautiful.”",2019-11-04T00:00:00.000,2019-11-12T00:00:00.000

These records will be used to associate against a set of records of all employees provided by the Department of Innovation and Technology. As such, should any of the requested records be unavailable, please let me know at your earliest.

I request that the file format be an excel file.

Important note: This request has been sent to all 34 Chicago departments listed on Chicago's website. Neither the Department of Innovation and Technology nor the Department of Human Resources maintain information WRT immediate superiors, and so a request to all departments is necessary. If there are any methods from any department to accumulate all requested records from all of Chicago from a single location, I would much prefer to go that route, and will then promptly withdraw any remaining requests.

Relevant text from similar request to the DoHR:
""Concerning your request for manager, direct reports, and email addresses, please note that each City department is a “public body” under Section 2 of FOIA, 5ILCS 140/2(a). See Duncan Publishing, Inc. v. City of Chicago, 304 III. App. 3d 778, 784, 709 N.E.2d 1281, 1286 (1st Dist. 1999) (“Clearly, each of the individual departments are subsidiary bodies of the City and are ‘public bodies’ as defined by the FOIA.”) A FOIA request must be directed to the department that maintains the records you are seeking. The Department of Human Resources does not have documents responsive to those portions of your request.""

The records responsive to this request are invaluable for understanding the underlying structure of the City of Chicago and its internal operation. As a result, the public's interest for this information far outweighs any burden and associated costs.",2019-01-25T00:00:00.000,2019-02-01T00:00:00.000
