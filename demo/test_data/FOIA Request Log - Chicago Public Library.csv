Any and all incident reports completed by staff and all complaints by patrons made on or about 11/04/14 related to the incident that Ellyn Weiss Schmitz talked about on Facebook. An incident repoprt is a loose term for any written summary, statement, notice, report or othe documentation of a man using a computer and engaging in sexual arousal as described by Schmitz on Facebook. I am looking to see if the Mt. Washington (sic) Library staff documented her complaint and the incident she complained about in any way. 2. All incident reports completed by Mt. Washington (sic) Library staff in the years 2012, 2013, and 2014. Hear, you may leave out reports of vandalism, theft, and other property related reports. I am interested in reports involving sexual activity, masturbation, pornography being accessed, men acosting women or children, violence, and other situations of that neture. Someone falling down and hurting himself would not be included in this FOIA search but someone being pushed down to the ground by another person would be. Someone spilling water on a computer and damaging it would not be included in this FOIA search but someone masturbating at a computer or arousing himself to porn at a computer would be. 3. All reports where the Mt. Washingtojn (sic) Library staff called the police to come to the Library in the years 2012, 2013, and 2014 and all records of police reports that were generated by those calls. 4. Any video or pictures that the Mt. Washington (sic) Library staff have of the man that Ellyn Weiss Schmitz reports to have seen arousing himself sexually at a computer. 5. The Patron Behavior Policy in effect at the Mt. Washington (sic) Library that would govern behavior such as sexual arousal at a computer in the Library. Is such behavior really allowed as the staff told Ellyn Weiss Schmitz or is this behavior not allowed? For instance, at the Harold Washington Library in downtown Chciago sexual arousal is not allowed and men engaging in sexual arousal, masturbation, or other such activiity are removed and the police are called. Does the Mt. Washington (sic) Library have a different policy from the Harold Washington Library? Please produce such a policy so that I can contrast it with the one I have on file for the Harold Washington Library. 6. Any and all correspondence the Mt. Washington (sic) Library has engaged in with parents in the last three years involving a parent complaining about a behavior issue of another libraru patron in the library and the library staff writing back to the parent with a response to that complaint. Here you may limit behavior issues to sexual activity, violence, drugs, or threatening behavior and once again eliminate theft, property damage, and general complaints about not having books or not meeting basic programming or scheduling needs and things of that nature.
