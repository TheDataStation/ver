These two devices, which appear to be shotspotter devices, were installed atop two CPD stations -- one on the 1438 W 63rd, and the other at 3315 W Ogden Ave. These devices appear to have both been installed in 2017 by Hartmann Electric Company and can be seen from the street.

The type of documents this request seeks include scope of work, memos, design plans, fee documents, approvals, documents sufficient to show that installation work was done (partially or otherwise), cost and payment documents (eg receipts), contract(s) of vendor(s) and their subcontractor(s). At minimum, I expect to receive documents that were filed as a requirement of city ordinance for these sorts of installation (radio/communications/antenna/electrical work on top of a municipal building).

This request is being sent to multiple agencies who may have been involved in the process at some point.. and to avoid another game of FOIA hot potato.

Anonymous,,"The specific violation and violation code number and definition for “wheels on curb” What code is being violated..Description and code number The following below is taken from City Clerk website” Park or Stand on Crosswalk It is illegal to park on a sidewalk, parkway or crosswalk. While most motorists know this, some do not know that in a private driveway that requires a vehicle to drive over a public sidewalk you cannot park your vehicle in your driveway with its rear or front extending over the pedestrian sidewalk. This is illegal, in part, because your vehicle may be impeding the ability of a person in a wheel chair to travel without difficulty on the sidewalk. Further, pedestrians, including parents or caregivers with strollers, have the right to expect the public way to be fully clear of impediments like parked vehicles. Similarly, you cannot park with your wheels on the curb. Vehicles that park with two wheels on a curb can seriously damage the curb. Further, many residents consider this practice unsightly.",2021-11-03T00:00:00.000,2021-11-10T00:00:00.000
