Anonymous {Kala},"I'd like to understand what the anti-corrosive phosphate additive that coats pipes does to the water? How does it interact with the lead in the pipes? 
I'm essentially wanting to know why the drinking water fountains are constantly on. Are they flushing out the anti-corrosive phosphate? 
How long is the Dept. of Water, Dept. of Public Health, and Parks Dept. planning on keeping this as the main method to keep drinking water safe?
I would also like to know what happens to the water once its ""wasted"" or goes into the drain in water fountains at parks. Does it get recycled back into the lake? Does it go to a waste water treatment plant?",2022-08-19T00:00:00.000,2022-08-26T00:00:00.000,

Leslie Edwards,"On Tuesday, March 29,2022, I called 311 to request that someone from the Water Department come to my house to inspect continuous water leaking from under my house via a pipe into my sump pump.  No one came out.  I called 311 that evening to follow up on the status of my report because no one came to my house.  The 311 representative told me that my report had been submitted and was pending.  On Wednesday, March 30, 2022, I called 311 again to check the status and Ms. Wright told me that the Water Department had stated that they had came out and said there was no evidence of a water break on the city side.  I asked if I could get a copy of the communication because no one had contacted me or sent me an email/text with this information.  Ms. Wright told me that she could not email/text that information to me and I would have to file a FOIA request.

After the work was completed, I filed a claim (21J02J877920) for plumbers costs to discover that there was a crushed tile in my street. Ever since the repairs, my water pressure was weak. I’ve had several visits by DWM and just today, 3/30/2022, Steve Kelly, from the meter department saw that the pressure coming into the meter was sub standard. Regarding my claim, my adjuster, Dennis Rafael, told me five times he was going to submit my claim and eventually, it was denied on 3/10/2022. Rafael said itb was a private drain issue though the tile was in the street. As the pressure issue has not yet been resolved,  I am requesting an extension to the statute of limitation on my original claim which expires 4/21/2022.
