NARRATIVE

I CARRIED OUT THE INSPECTION OF ADVANCED ON-SITE CONCRETE INCORPORATED, DUE TO CITIZEN COMPLAINT. IT WAS ALLEGED THAT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DUST ESCAPE OUT OF STORAGE SILOS, COVERS HIS CARS AND YARD. UPON ARRIVAL AT THE SITE I OBSERVED PLUME OF DUST FROM THE BAGHOUSE (DUST COLLECTION SYSTEM) ON TOP OF THE CEMENT SILO. I APPROACHED THE FACILITY AND SAW A CEMENT TRUCK CARRYING OUT UNLOADING ACTIVITIES OF CEMENT INTO THE SILOS (SEE PHOTO# 22). AS SOON AS HE SAW ME HE STOPPED UNLOADING OPERATIONS. I LATER MET THE PLANT MANAGER KEITH COLEMAN, WHO TOLD ME THE OWNER OF THE FACILITY WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. HE CALLED HIM ON THE PHONE, AND THEY SPOKE TOGETHER. 

I ASKED TO BE TAKEN TO THE TOP OF THE SILOS IN ORDER TO INSPECT THE BAGS INSIDE THE BAGHOUSE. GEORGE, ONE OF THE STAFF CLIMBED WITH ME THE SILOS. THE SILO WAS VERY TALL (ABOUT 100FT ABOVE THE GROUND LEVEL). ITS HEIGHT MAKES AND ITS PROXIMITY TO THE FENCE LINES OF THE ADJACENT PROPERTIES, MAKE IT VERY EASY THE CEMENT PLUME RELEASED FROM THE BAGHOUSE TO MIGRATE OFF SITE (SEE PHOTO#S 14 AND 21). I TOLD THE PLANT MANAGER KEITH TO CONTINUE TO UNLOAD THE CEMENT INTO THE SILOS SO THAT HE CAN SEE THE PROBLEM THAT I OBSERVED WHILE ARRIVING AT THE SITE. HE REFUSED TO CONTINUE WHILE I WAS THERE. BELOW ARE MY OBSERVATIONS:

PARTICULATE MATERS AND FUGITIVE DUST EMISSIONS FROM CEMENT SILOS (SEE PHOTO#S1, 2, 3, 4 AND 5);

CEMENT ACCUMULATIONS ON THE TOP OF THE SILOS, FROM THE BAGHOUSE, WHICH COULD BE SEEN WASHED AWAY BY RAIN WATER (SEE PHOTO#S 6, 7, 12, AND 13);

EXCESSIVE CEMENT DUST COULD BE SEEN ALL OVER THE BAGS INSIDE THE BAGHOUSE, AN INDICATOR OF A IMPROPER INSTALLATION, OR FAULTY BAGS INSIDE THE BAGHOUSE (SEE PHOTO#S 8, 9, 10 AND 11);

ILLEGAL TRANSFER STATION, I OBSERVED DEMOLITION MATERIAL PILES IN DIFFERENT STORAGE AREAS (SEE PHOTO#S 16, 17, 18, 19, AND 20);

DUSTY AND DRY TRUCKING AREAS (SEE PHOTO#S 14, 21 AND 22),

LOCATED AT THE ABOVE ADDRESS. .","[INSPECTION LOG #: 7025 22-AUG-13 12:15:00] THE INSPECTORS INCLUDED GEORGE HAIRSTON, JR., SENIOR ENVIRONMENTAL INSPECTOR; JOHN KRYL, DIRECTOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL INSPECTIONS; AND RENANTE MARANTE, ENGINEER III, PERMITTINGDIVISION,FROM THE CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH (CDPH), AND RICHARD FINLEY FROM THE ILLINOIS ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (IEPA). LAUREL SIMS IS IN CHARGE OF PRODUCTION AND MARKETING FOR GROWING POWER, INC. ERIKA ALLEN ((312) 735-4833), IS THE PROJECT DIRECTOR.BRIAN ELLIS IS A SITE SUPERVISOR. WE MET WITH BRIAN ELLIS AND LAUREL SIMS WHILE ON SITE. 


UPON ARRIVING FOR AN IEPA DEVELOPMENT PERMIT INSPECTION, WE FOUND THAT THE SITE HAD ALREADY BEGAN COMPOSTING WITHOUT THEIR IEPA OPERATING PERMIT, NOR THEIR CITY CLASS III PERMIT, FOR APPROXIMATELY THE LAST TWO MONTHS. LAUREL CLAIMED THAT SOMEONE FROM THE CDPH, WHO SHE COULDN'T NAME, HAD GIVEN THEM PERMISSION TO COMMENCE OPERATIONS WITHOUT THE NECESSARY PERMITS. 


THE COMPOSTING IS BEING CONDUCTED INSIDE A HOOP HOUSE, APPROXIMATELY20 FEET WIDE BY100 FEET LONG, AND 8 TO 10 FEET TALL. THE HOOP HOUSE CONSISTED OF A PLASTIC TARP STRETCHED OVER A METAL FRAME. AS THE FRONT AND BACK OF THE HOOP HOUSE WAS OPEN TO THE ELEMENTS, THE COMPOST OPERATION MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED ?IN-VESSEL? AS DEFINED IN CHAPTER 11-4-2510 OF THE CITY ORDINANCE. 


THE REAR OF THE SITE, BEHIND THE BUILDING, WAS COMPLETELY COVERED WITH WOOD CHIPS TO A DEPTH OF BETWEEN ONE AND TWO FEET IN THICKNESS. IT WAS RAINING AT THE TIME OF OUR INSPECTION, AND THE WOOD CHIP GROUNDCOVER WAS COMPLETELY WATERLOGGED, SITTING IN APPROXIMATELY HALF A FOOT OF WATER. THERE WERE DEEP RUTS IN THE WOOD CHIPS CAUSED BY EQUIPMENT OR VEHICLE TRAFFIC. ACCORDING TO GROWING POWER?S IEPA PERMIT APPLICATION, CONCRETE PAVING UNDERLIES THE WOOD CHIPS AND AN ONSITE STORM WATER SYSTEM COLLECTS AND DISCHARGES THE SITE?S RUNOFF TO THE CITY?S COMBINED SEWER SYSTEM. HOWEVER, BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF STANDING WATER AT THE TIME OF INSPECTION, IT APPEARED THAT THE ONSITE STORM WATER SYSTEM WASEITHER NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY OR DID NOT SERVE THE COMPOST AND ADJACENT AREAS. (BASED ON MIDWAY AIRPORT PRECIPITATION DATA, THE AREA RECEIVED 0.36' OF RAIN THE PREVIOUS DAY AND 1.51'BETWEEN AUGUST 1, 2013 AND AUGUST 22, 2013).


LAUREL SIMS INFORMED US THAT THEY HAD CONSTRUCTED A BERM ALONG THE SOUTH PORTION OF THE SITE TO PREVENT RUNOFF INTO BUBBLY CREEK. WE NOTIFIED MS. SIMS THAT SUCH CONSTRUCTION MAY REQUIRE A PERMIT FROM THE CITY AND THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES IF THE PROPERTY IS WITHIN A FEDERAL SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA). WE REQUESTED HER TO SEND US A TOPOGRAPHIC SURVEY OF THE SITE, IF AVAILABLE, SO THAT WE CAN CONFIRM THE FLOODPLAIN STATUS OF THE PROPERTY.(CDPHLATER CONFIRMED THE PROPERTY TO BEOUTSIDE THE SFHA. APPROXIMATE BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE)FOR BUBBLY CREEK IS 583.68'.LOWEST ELEVATION OF THE TOP OF BANK (FROM APPENDIX E OF IEPA PERMIT APPLICATION) IS 586.00'.)

THE FACILITY ENGAGES IN MOTOR VEHICLE REPAIR, EXCLUSIVELY HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS, TRAILERS, AND TRACTORS. FACILITY IS NOT AN AUTO BODY REFINISHER AND NO SPRAY BOOTH WAS FOUND. 

AT THE TIME OF INSPECTION I OBSERVED DIFFERENT SIZES OF WASTE OIL AND ANTIFREEZE CONTAINERS FILLED WITH LIQUID WASTE. 

THERE WERE ABOUT 3 LARGE PLASTIC TANKS FILLED WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED GALLONS OF AUTOMOTIVE LIQUID WASTE SPILLING OIL ON THE GROUND, ITOLD THE MANAGER IT APPEARS LIKE EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK IN THE SHOP WAS OIL BECAUSE OF POOR MANAGEMENT OF WASTE OIL. 

I INSTRUCTED THE MANAGER TO PLACE THE DRUMS AND THE CONTAINERSIN SECONDARY CONTAINMENTS TO PREVENT SPILL. I INQUIRED OF WHICH COMPANY WAS CONTRACTED TO PICK UP THE WASTE OIL FOR DISPOSAL HE REPLIED NONE BECAUSE HE BURNS IT FOR HEAT. 

I SAW A CATCH BASIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOP FILLED WITH MIXTURE OF WATER AND A LITTLE OIL SHINE 

DURING MY EXIT INTERVIEW I WARNED THE MANAGER MR. ENOC HERNANDEZ TO PRACTICE GOOD HOUSEKEEPING AND TO DISPOSE HIS WASTE PROPERLY WITH SOME OFFICIAL WASTE DISPOSAL COMPANIES. 

I INFORMED HIM THAT FACILITY WAS FOUND IN VIOLATION OF CITY CODE 11-4-1500 TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID OR LIQUID WASTE.
