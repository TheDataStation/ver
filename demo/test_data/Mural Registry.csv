19001,Kerry James Marshall,Rush More,Painting,2017,"Chicago Cultural Center, West FaÃ§ade",78 E Washington St,60602,42,DCASE,"This large-scale mural on the Chicago Cultural Center building is the culmination the cityâ€™s Year of Public Art. Made by internationally renowned Artist Kerry James Marshall, the 132 x 100-foot muralâ€”the largest artwork he has ever designed or createdâ€”honors 20 women who have shaped the cityâ€™s vibrant arts and cultural landscape. In explaining his choice of women, Kerry James Marshall said, â€œIn the history of monuments you have very few that represent women, but in the history of Chicago you have very many women that played key roles in establishing culture here. . . . My idea was to make a Forest Rushmore acknowledging the contribution of 20 women whoâ€™ve worked to shape the cultural landscape of the city, past and present.â€ The mural, executed by Artist Jeff Zimmerman, consists of trees as totems decorated by the womenâ€™s faces on the bottom. Up above are the park-like treetops, birds, a yellow-and-blue sun, and a ribbon that floats throughout the mural. 

The cross-cultural, multi-generational list of women include (left to right) actress and cofounder of Dearborn Homes Youth Drama Workshop Cheryl Lynn Bruce; founder of Chicago Childrenâ€™s Theatre Jacqueline Russell; former Chicago First lady and founder of After School Matters Maggie Daley; founder of the DuSable Museum of African American History Margaret Burroughs; founder of Little Black Pearl Monica Haslip; television host and producer Oprah Winfrey; poet Gwendolyn Brooks; former Chicago cultural affairs commissioner Lois Weisberg; actress/writer, and cofounder of Collaboraction theater, Sandra Delgado; journalist and writer Achy Obejas; founder of eta Creative Arts Foundation Abena Joan Brown; Poetry magazine founder Harriet Monroe; founder of Black Ensemble Theater Jackie Taylor; founder and Artistic director of Chicago Shakespeare Theater Barbara Gaines; former director of the Renaissance Society Suzanne Ghez; dancer and president of Muntu Dance Theatre of Chicago Joan Gray; dancer, choreographer, and founder of Ruth Page Center for the Arts Ruth Page; writer Sandra Ciseneros; Artist and cofounder of the AfricCobra  collective Barbara Jones-Hogu; Janes Saks, founder of Project & and the Ellen stone Belic Institute for the study of Women and Gender in the Arts and Media.

The Audubon Mural Project began in 2014 as a public art initiative of the National Audubon Society, in partnership with the Harlem-based Gitler &_____ Gallery of upper Manhattan, New York. The goal of the project is to paint murals honoring North American bird species that Audubon’s research has determined are threatened by climate change in this century, in order to bring awareness to this environmental crisis.     A report published in 2014 found that 314 North American bird species will be severely threatened by future climate change.

It allows us to pay attention and to be connected to it and thus be connected with others. My desire to contribute something positive and worthwhile is so strong one might say art is what makes me feel human.

They first met when they worked on last year’s Mile of Murals project.    About their response to the theme and their design for the wall, the collective says, “The core of our understanding of Patriotism in Everyday Life resides in this culturally negotiated understanding of “freedom”, i.e. in the perceptions, contradictions, questions, problems and issues that for more than 200 years continue to be challenged and re-defined. It is embedded in a persistent struggle to define and achieve freedom. It is distinctly opposed to casting American values in bellicose chauvinism, or a belief in national superiority. The American narrative is one of a deep striving toward personal success and individual freedom within a social, economic and political fabric of shared liberty and rights. The movement towards these ideals has been rocky, sometimes heroic and enlightened, sometimes ugly and violent, but the vision continues to inspire.”",01,42.0086457,-87.66561428,"{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [-87.66561428, 42.0086457]}",9,10,21853,66,5,

Madison Ave., Chicago, IL 60624",4333 W Madison Ave,60624,28,,"This mural was created by the City Bricks Project, a project founded and led by  videographer/filmmaker Khosro Adam Beik. The mural displays U.S. Census Bureau  statistics demonstrating disparity between the community of West Garfield Park and more  affluent Chicago-area communities. The data is intended to enhance awareness and  inform the public about issues impacting disinvested communities such as W. Garfield  Park, while underscoring the urgency of these issues. Since information is power, the  project democratizes data so everyone can speak about them in order to find solutions.  The statistics, which will be updated with new Census information as available and after  election cycles, include: life expectancy, median household income, high school  graduation rates, households in poverty, and median home value. The mural states that  these conditions result in lower opportunity for children to thrive compared to other  communities, and includes a space for local residents to place their signatures as a gesture  of endorsement.    The mural is located on one wall of a building that is privately owned and operated as  Nexx Phaze Barber/Beauty/Studio.    The impetus for the mural was the great disparity in life expectancy between W. Garfield  Park and nearby, more affluent communities. Through a companion feature-length  documentary film, ""We Witness,"" Khosro Beik interviewed local residents, business  owners and leaders to shed light on the statistics. The film screened multiple times on  WTTW channel 11, and is currently streaming for three years on WTTW's website. The  City Bricks Project is a collaborative endeavor that plans additional murals, films, public  engagement opportunities, and partnerships in Chicago and elsewhere.  www.CityBricksProject.com    The mural and film have helped to galvanize attention to the issues present in the  community and resources needed to solve them, such as the Sankofa Wellness Village, a  project of the Garfield Park Rite to Wellness Collaborative, which was awarded the 2nd  Annual Chicago Prize from the Pritzker Traubert Foundation in January 2023. We expect that the mural will continue to inspire engagement with and solutions for social justice issues in W. Garfield Park and other communities.",26,41.88051378,-87.73436187,"{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [-87.73436187, 41.88051378]}",30,27,21572,717,23,

In order to capture the essence of this phrase, I portrayed a lush bouquet of Chrysanthemums, Roses, Echinacea, and prairie grasses. Each of these blooms can be found in the city and serves a purpose in the bouquet apart from making a beautiful arrangement. Chrysanthemums are Chicago's official flower, so they are featured most prominently in the mural. Roses are universally recognizable and loved, but they were also Anne Hewlett Fuller's favorite, and the bloom that the famous Chicagoan architect and designer Buckminster Fuller gave her in courtship. Echinacea and prairie grasses are both found growing wild in Chicago, a nod to the abundance of beautiful wild foliage in Illinois. The symbolic blooms coupled with the title of the piece honor the city's close and nuanced relationship with nature.""

of Special Service Area 27 and its 501(c)(3) non-profit partner organization, Friends of Lakeview which showases original works of art by innovative artists throughout the West Lakeview neighborhood.

The design inspiration comes from my family heirlooms-""carpetas tejidas"" the delicate and intricate original crocheted designs of my grandmother and great grandmother. After watching some of Luzia, I reflected on the massive red papel picado that was used to incubate the twirling dancer ascending in one of the scenes as flower petals fell. Upon first sight it immediately made me think of the many designs links that make up my grandmaï¿½s doilies. I allowed the connection to guide the process of the mural's details. The dripping effect is a direct reflection of the water scenes and rather than make it a focal point, I wanted to create a subtle resemblance to the water while keeping it connected to my graffiti roots. Drips are common and often the most enjoyable parts of ink tags and natural spray paint abstracts when doing stylized letters. It is important for me to stay true to my Mexican & Graffiti culture for the two has been an integral part of my life and visual art form. I want to honor and elevate them in ways that donï¿½t appropriate or erase the values or struggles that have endured through their evolution and survival.ï¿½ The Magia de Luzia was curated and organized by Columbia College Chicago as part of the Wabash Arts Corridor Street Level Public Art Exhibition, and sponsored by Cirque du Soleil in honor of the production LUZIA in Chicago, Illinois.",32,41.87557316,-87.62637611,"{'type': 'Point', 'coordinates': [-87.62637611, 41.87557316]}",35,38,14913,367,10,
