Alderman Cardenas asked his constituents in McKinley Park and sided with them on their choice NOT to host. YET he has ignored constituents of Little Village and North Lawndale for the past 7 years and has banked on it too! We do not trust anyone Cardenas supports for temporary 12th ward alder. 

We need someone who will actually work with his neighbors to address mega festivals in Douglass Park. We are still paying 12th ward payroll, anyone in the aldermanic role should prioritize this issue!"

Development in the area needs to focus on the wellbeing of the constituents in the ward. We don’t need more toxic factories/companies in the area."

As shown in multiple news investigations, he has been trading campaign cash, and jobs and money to family members in exchange for zoning changes, business approvals, and permits for parks. It would be unacceptable to pretend our input matters and then just appoint one of his people."

We want business development, but people who live here should have priority over outsiders in determining what that looks like. 

The environmental impacts of ""development"" without community involvement have caused significant issues.  We want to see MAT Asphalt shut down, the drive through ban in TOD zones enacted, downzoning of industrial lots, and zoning changes on 35th St to allow residents to open a small business in vacant storefronts previously downzoned to residential."
