But If he received a specific license for his trip to the island after that date, I want a copy of that instead. 4. Under federal law, travelers who visit Cuba on authorized trips are required to create and retain detailed records of those trips for five years, should the Office of Foreign Assets Control perform an audit. I am requesting a copy of those records as well. 5. As you know, the Illinois Freedom of Information Act permits you to respond within five business days. As mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel is a public official whose salary is paid via tax dollars and he is therefore accountable to the public. His trip to Cuba is also common knowledge, because it made news via POLITICO and the mayor's office talked about the trip in a Dec. 21 article that ran in the Chicago Sun-Times.

Mark Flatten,Goldwater Institute,"information about your city’s use of “release time” or “official time,” the practice by which city employees are released from their regular duties to conduct business for their union, collective bargaining unit or labor organization, while still drawing pay and benefits from their government employer. For the purpose of illustration, the federal equivalent of what I am seeking is known as “official time” and is permitted under 5 USC ss 7131. Cities throughout the country allow similar practices, though sometimes by different names.
Please provide me with the following records:
1: A searchable and sortable database, spreadsheet or other document which shows the total annual cost, hours and purpose of release time used in your city for the past five years. This should include the hours and cost of lobbying on behalf of the union while on paid release time from the city.
2: The database should include the name, job title, department, annual pay, union or bargaining unit affiliation, and a breakdown of cost and total hours taken by each individual who used at least 1,000 hours of release time in any of the last five years. In the event that an individual’s name is protected under your state’s public records law, I would ask that each individual be assigned a unique identifying number so that the total annual number of hours for each individual can be tracked separately. In making this request, I am not waiving any rights to challenge your attempts to withhold the names, but will review your response individually based on the statute in your state. In any case, if the name is withheld, all other requested information shall be supplied.
3: The relevant sections of any union/bargaining unit contracts which specify the terms, conditions, reporting requirements and permitted uses of release time.
