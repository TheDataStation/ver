138323,Adult Book Discussion: Things We Lost In The Water,"Join the West Loop Branch for a discussion of Things We Lost to the Water by Eric Nguyen. When Huong arrives in New Orleans with her two young sons, she is jobless, homeless, and worried about her husband, Cong, who remains in Vietnam. As she and her boys begin to settle into life in America, she continues to send letters and tapes back to Cong, hopeful that they will be reunited, and her children will grow up with a father. Over time, Huong realizes she will never see Cong again. While she copes with this loss, her sons, Tuan and Binh, grow up in their absent father's shadow, haunted by a man and a country trapped in their memory and imagination. As they push forward, the three adapt to life in America in different ways: Huong takes up with a Vietnamese car salesman who is also new in town; Tuan tries to connect with his heritage by joining a local Vietnamese gang; and Binh, now going by Ben, embraces his burgeoning sexuality. Their search for identity--as individuals and as a family--tears them apart, until disaster strikes, and they must find a new way to come together and honor the ties that bind them.How to Attend This event takes place on Zoom.

105896,Feminist Book Club: Bad Feminist,"Join Independence Branch for an online discussion of feminist fiction and non-fiction!Our second title to be discussed will be Roxane Gay's Bad Feminist.&nbsp;&nbsp;""This trenchant collection assembles previously published essays and new work by cultural critic and novelist Gay (An Untamed State). Even though she loves pink, feels nostalgic about the Sweet Valley High series, and lets degrading rap lyrics blast from her car stereo, Gay is passionately committed to feminist issues, such as equal opportunity and pay and reproductive freedom. Writing about race, politics, gender, feminism, privilege, and popular media, she highlights how deeply misogyny is embedded in our culture, the careless language used to discuss sexual violence (seen in news reports of sexual assault), Hollywood's tokenistic treatment of race, the trivialization of literature written by women, and the many ways American society fails women and African-Americans. Gay bemoans that fact that role models like Bill Cosby and Don Lemon urge African-Americans to act like ideal citizens while glossing over institutional problems in the education, social welfare, and justice system that exacerbate racism and poverty. Although Gay is aware of her privilege as a middle-class Haitian-American, she doesn't refrain from advising inner-city students to have higher expectations. Whatever her topic, Gay's provocative essays stand out for their bravery, wit, and emotional honesty."" ---Publisher's WeeklyHow to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

120924,Voices for Justice: Poet Cathy Park Hong,"Chicago Public Library's&nbsp;Poetry Committee&nbsp;is pleased to welcome Cathy Park Hong for a virtual event in celebration of Poetry Fest and as part of our ongoing Voices for Justice series. She will be in conversation with fellow poet Erin Adair-Hodges.&nbsp;Credit: Beowful Sheehan Cathy Park Hong is an award-winning poet, a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the author of Minor Feelings: An Asian American Reckoning. In this widely celebrated book of essays, Hong provocatively infuses cultural criticism, history, and her own person experience to reveal hard truths about the American racialized consciousness. In engaging and revealing talks, Hong speaks about race and Asian American identity, utilizing the craft of poetry as a lens for social change, and the power of creating art that is influenced by politics, culture, and the current societal moment.Minor Feelings is a radically honest meditation on the Asian American experience. Cathy Park Hong draws upon her background as a poet and the daughter of Korean immigrants to create a work that flows seamlessly between cultural analysis, personal anecdotes, and historical framework. Hong writes about how her upbringing was steeped in shame and self-loathing.These √íminor feelings,√ì she comes to understand in the book, were the result of believing the stereotypes that American society fed her about her own racial identity. Praised by Claudia Rankine, Jia Tolentino, and other prominent writers of our time, Minor Feelings is a critical work that reckons with our racialized past and present. Time named Minor Feelings as one of the top 10 Non-Fiction books of 2020.Cathy Park Hong is also the author of three poetry collections including Dance Dance Revolution (which won the Barnard Women Poets Prize),Engine Empire, and Translating Mo√ïUm. She is a recipient of the Windham-Campbell Prize, the Guggenheim Fellowship, and the National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship.Her poems have been published in Poetry, The New York Times, The Paris Review, McSweeney√ïs, The Boston Review, and other journals. She is the poetry editor of the New Republic and full professor at the Rutgers University-Newark MFA program in poetry.She will be in conversation with Erin Adair-Hodges.&nbsp;Erin Adair-Hodges is the winner of the 2016 Agnes Lynch Starrett Prize for her first poetry collection Let's All Die Happy, published by the University of Pittsburgh Press as part of the Pitt Poetry Series in 2017. Her second book, Every Form of Ruin, is forthcoming from Pitt in spring 2023.A poet/essayist born and raised in New Mexico, Erin earned an MFA from the University of Arizona and then quit poetry; eight years later, her first accepted poem wonThe Georgia Review√îs Loraine Williams Prize. Her work can also be seen now or soon in American Poetry Review, Boulevard, Crazyhorse, Green Mountains Review, Kenyon Review, Ploughshares, Prairie Schooner, AGNI and more. Until 2022, Erin was an Assistant Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Central Missouri and the co-editor of Pleiades √êshe is now an Acquisitions Editor for Lake Union Publishing, acquiring the best in upmarket commercial fiction.This program is made possible thanks to generous support from the Poetry Foundation and the Chicago&nbsp;Public Library Foundation.How to Attend:This event will take place live on CPL's YouTube channel&nbsp;and CPL's&nbsp;Facebook page.&nbsp;You'll be able to ask questions during the event as well!&nbsp;Can't make it to the live stream?

Gender affirmative garments are important because they enable trans and gender non-conforming people to live authentically in their bodies, which supports better mental health (according to The Trevor Project, access to gender affirming clothing can reduce the likelihood of youth suicide attempts: https://www.thetrevorproject.org/survey-2020/?section=Supporting-Transgender-Nonbinary-Youth)We invite you to explore the following resources on the relationship between gender expression and clothing to learn more:Own-voices article: https://www.them.us/story/clothes-shopping-gender-nonconformingIn-depth definitions of gender affirming garments: http://www.phsa.ca/transcarebc/care-support/transitioning/bind-pack-tuck-padMaia Kobabe√ïs graphic novel memoir Gender QueerA note from Sky: Remember you don√ït have to wear any of these garments in order to be trans or nonbinary.

Copies of the book are available in the Popular Library at the Harold Washington Library Center.√íAn entrancing tale of piracy colored with gold, treachery and double-dealing (Portland Press Herald), Pulitzer Prize-finalist Colin Woodward's The Republic of Pirates is the historical biography of the exploits of infamous Caribbean buccaneers.In the early eighteenth century, the Pirate Republic was home to some of the great pirate captains, including Edward Blackbeard Teach, Black Sam Bellamy, and Charles Vane. Along with their fellow pirates -- former sailors, indentured servants, and runaway slaves -- this Flying Gang established a crude but distinctive democracy in the Bahamas, carving out their own zone of freedom in which servants were free, blacks could be equal citizens, and leaders were chosen or deposed by a vote.They cut off trade routes, sacked slave ships, and severed Europe from its New World empires. For a brief, glorious period the Republic was a success as the pirates became heroes in the eyes of the people.Drawing on extensive research in the archives of Britain and the Americas, award-winning author Colin Woodard tells the dramatic untold story of the Pirate Republic that shook the very foundations of the British and Spanish Empires and fanned the democratic sentiments that would one day drive the American revolution.√ì - from the publisher, Mariner BooksHow to Attend This event takes place on Zoom.

With his single mother in jail, Sequoyah, a fifteen-year-old Cherokee boy, is placed in foster care with the Troutt family. Literally and figuratively scarred by his unstable upbringing, Sequoyah has spent years mostly keeping to himself, living with his emotions pressed deep below the surface--that is, until he meets the seventeen-year-old Rosemary, another youth staying with the Troutts. Sequoyah and Rosemary bond over their shared Native American backgrounds and tumultuous paths through the foster care system, but as Sequoyah's feelings toward Rosemary deepen, the precariousness of their lives and the scars of their pasts threaten to undo them both.""How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

126044,Adult Book Discussion: GIVE UNTO OTHERS,"Join the Adult Book Discussion at the Austin Branch Library for a discussion o Give Unto Others by Donna Leon.""What role can or should loyalty play in the life of a police inspector? It's a question Commissario Guido Brunetti must face and ultimately answer... Brunetti is approached for a favor by Elisabetta Foscarini, a woman he knows casually, but her mother was good to Brunetti's mother, so he feels obliged to at least look into the matter privately, and not as official police business. Foscarini's son-in-law, Enrico Fenzo, has alarmed his wife (her daughter) by confessing their family might be in danger because of something he's involved with. Since Fenzo is an accountant, Brunetti logically suspects the cause of danger is related to the finances of a client. Yet his clients seem benign: an optician, a restaurateur, a charity established by his father-in-law. However, when his friend's daughter's place of work is vandalized, Brunetti asks his own favors--that his colleagues Claudia Griffoni, Lorenzo Vianello, and Signorina Elettra Zorzi assist his private investigation, which soon enough turns official as they uncover the dark and Janus-faced nature of a venerable Italian institution. Exploring the wobbly line between the criminal and non-criminal, revealing previously untold elements of Brunetti's past, Give unto Others shows that the price of reciprocity can be steep.""How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

126043,Adult Book Club: Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead,"Join the Merlo Branch Adult Book Club for a discussion of by Drive your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead by Olga Tokarczuk.In a remote Polish village, Janina devotes the dark winter days to studying astrology, translating the poetry of William Blake, and taking care of the summer homes of wealthy Warsaw residents. Her reputation as a crank and a recluse is amplified by her not-so-secret preference for the company of animals over humans. Then a neighbor, Big Foot, turns up dead. Soon other bodies are discovered, in increasingly strange circumstances. As suspicions mount, Janina inserts herself into the investigation, certain that she knows whodunit. If only anyone would pay her mind . . .A deeply satisfying thriller cum fairy tale, Drive Your Plow over the Bones of the Dead is a provocative exploration of the murky borderland between sanity and madness, justice and tradition, autonomy and fate. Whom do we deem sane? it asks. Who is worthy of a voice?How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom. Register at least 24 hours before the event. Only one registration per household is needed.

114730,Non-Fiction Book Discussion: The Address Book,"All are welcome to join a discussion of The Address Book: What Street Addresses Reveal About Identity, Race, Wealth, and Power.&nbsp;""When most people think about street addresses, if they think of them at all, it is in their capacity to ensure that the postman can deliver mail, or a traveler won√ït get lost. But street addresses were not invented to help you find your way; they were created to find you. In many parts of the world, your address can reveal your race and class.In this wide-ranging and remarkable book, Deirdre Mask looks at the fate of streets named after Martin Luther King Jr., the wayfinding means of ancient Romans, and how Nazis haunt the streets of modern Germany. The flipside of having an address is not having one, and we also see what that means for millions of people today, including those who live in the slums of Kolkata and on the streets of London. Filled with fascinating people and histories, The Address Book illuminates the complex and sometimes hidden stories behind street names and their power to name, to hide, to decide who counts, who doesn√ït√ëand why."" - from the publisher, St. Martin's PressHow to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

Raised in the Los Angeles hinterlands by a hippie mom, Alex dropped out of school early and into a world of shady drug-dealer boyfriends, dead-end jobs, and much, much worse. In fact, by age twenty, she is the sole survivor of a horrific, unsolved multiple homicide. Some might say she's thrown her life away. But at her hospital bed, Alex is offered a second chance: to attend one of the world's most prestigious universities on a full ride. What's the catch, and why her? Still searching for answers, Alex arrives in New Haven tasked by her mysterious benefactors with monitoring the activities of Yale's secret societies. Their eight windowless ""tombs"" are the well-known haunts of the rich and powerful, from high-ranking politicos to Wall Street's biggest players.

105985,David Sadowski on Chicago√ïs Lost Ls,"Chicago√ïs system of elevated railways, known locally as the √íL,√ì has run continuously since 1892 and, like the city, has never stood still. It helped neighborhoods grow, brought their increasingly diverse populations together, and gave the famous Loop its name. But today√ïs system has changed radically over the years. Chicago's Lost ""L""s tells the story of former lines such as Garfield Park, Humboldt Park, Kenwood, Stockyards, Normal Park, Westchester, and Niles Center. It was once possible to take high-speed trains on the L directly to Aurora, Elgin, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The L started out as four different companies, two starting out using steam engines instead of electricity. Eventually, all four came together via the Union Loop. The L is more than a way of getting around. Its trains are a place where people meet and interact. Some say the best way to experience the city is via the L, with its second-story view. Chicago√ïs Lost √íL√ìs is virtually a √ísecret history√ì of Chicago, and this is your ticket.Author&nbsp;David Sadowski grew up riding the L all over the city. He is the author of&nbsp;Chicago Trolleys and Building Chicago's Subways and runs the online Trolley Dodger blog.How to Attend:This event will take place live on CPL's YouTube channel. and CPL's&nbsp;Facebook page.&nbsp;You'll be able to ask questions during the event as well!&nbsp;Can't make it to the live stream?

The captives include a recently retired couple who relentlessly hunt down fixer-uppers to avoid the painful truth that they can't fix their own marriage. There's a wealthy bank director who has been too busy to care about anyone else and a young couple who are about to have their first child but can't seem to agree on anything. Add to the mix an eighty-seven-year-old woman who has lived long enough not to be afraid of someone waving a gun in her face, a flustered but still-ready-to-make-a-deal real estate agent, and a mystery man who has locked himself in the apartment's only bathroom, and you've got the worst group of hostages in the world. Each of them carries a lifetime of grievances, hurts, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over. None of them is entirely who they appear to be. And all of them--the bank robber included--desperately crave some sort of rescue. As the authorities and the media surround the premises, these reluctant allies will reveal surprising truths about themselves and set in motion a chain of events so unexpected that even they can hardly explain what happens next.""  --PublisherHow to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

113960,Sci-Fi/Fantasy Book Club: Black Sun,"Join Brighton Park Branch for a book discussion of Black Sun&nbsp;by Rebecca Roanhorse.√íIn the holy city of Tova, the winter solstice is usually a time for celebration and renewal, but this year it coincides with a solar eclipse, a rare celestial event proscribed by the Sun Priest as an unbalancing of the world. Meanwhile, a ship launches from a distant city bound for Tova and set to arrive on the solstice. The captain of the ship, Xiala, is a disgraced Teek whose song can calm the waters around her as easily as it can warp a man's mind. Her ship carries one passenger. Described as harmless, the passenger, Serapio, is a young man, blind, scarred, and cloaked in destiny. As Xiala well knows, when a man is described as harmless, he usually ends up being a villain.""&nbsp;&nbsp;The the first book in this trilogy is inspired by the civilizations of the Pre-Columbian America.&nbsp;&nbsp;--Provided by publisher.How to attend:&nbsp;This event takes place on Zoom.

113491,'Steenth Street: Alice Dunbar-Nelson's Stories of Black Childhood,"Come learn about a project to recover a short story collection written in the 1890s by Black author, activist, and educator Alice Dunbar-Nelson. Inspired by her work teaching kindergarteners at the White Rose Mission in New York City, Dunbar-Nelson wrote a series of wry short stories featuring the youngest residents of an urban neighborhood targeted for uplift by Progressive-era reformers. √íThe Annals of √ïSteenth Street,√ì as Dunbar-Nelson titled the planned collection, chronicles a vibrant, working poor community. Although the stories never saw print as a group, scholars recently discovered that Dunbar-Nelson published six of them in 1900 and 1901 in The Chicago Daily News, a metropolitan daily with a broad readership. This is the first in a series of public forums about Dunbar-Nelson's story collection and the challenges of recovering Black-authored literature.Participants will include&nbsp;Denise Burgher, doctoral candidate, University of Delaware;&nbsp;Brigitte Fielder, associate professor, University of Wisconsin-Madison; and&nbsp;Jean Lutes, Luckow Family Endowed Chair in English Literature, Villanova University.How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.

144896,Adult Book Club: Shadow Diver,"The Merlo Adult Book Club discusses&nbsp;Shadow Divers&nbsp;by Robert Kurson. Books are available on 2nd FL.In the tradition of Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air and Sebastian Junger's The Perfect Storm comes a true tale of riveting adventure in which two weekend scuba divers risk everything to solve a great historical mystery--and make history themselves.For John Chatterton and Richie Kohler, deep wreck diving was more than a sport. Testing themselves against treacherous currents, braving depths that induced hallucinatory effects, navigating through wreckage as perilous as a minefield, they pushed themselves to their limits and beyond, brushing against death more than once in the rusting hulks of sunken ships.But in the fall of 1991, not even these courageous divers were prepared for what they found 230 feet below the surface, in the frigid Atlantic waters sixty miles off the coast of New Jersey: a World War II German U-boat, its ruined interior a macabre wasteland of twisted metal, tangled wires, and human bones--all buried under decades of accumulated sediment.No identifying marks were visible on the submarine, or the few artifacts brought to the surface. No historian, expert, or government had a clue as to which U-boat the men had found. In fact, the official records all agreed that there simply could not be a sunken U-boat and crew at that location.Over the next six years, an elite team of divers embarked on a quest to solve the mystery. Some of them would not live to see its end. Chatterton and Kohler, at first bitter rivals, would be drawn into a friendship that deepened to an almost mystical sense of brotherhood with each other and with the drowned U-boat sailors--former enemies of their country. As the men's marriages frayed under the pressure of a shared obsession, their dives grew more daring, and each realized that he was hunting more than the identities of a lost U-boat and its nameless crew.Author Robert Kurson's account of this quest is at once thrilling and emotionally complex, and it is written with a vivid sense of what divers actually experience when they meet the dangers of the ocean's underworld. The story of Shadow Divers often seems too amazing to be true, but it all happened, two hundred thirty feet down, in the deep blue sea.How to AttendThis event is available in person and online.Attend in person at the Merlo Branch 644 W Belmont.Masks are strongly encouraged in all CPL locations.

114182,Food Memoir Book Discussion: Save Me the Plums,"Join a librarian from Legler Regional in a new book club featuring food memoirs! We will discuss Save Me the Plums by Ruth Reichl.""When Cond¬é Nast offered Ruth Reichl the top position at America's oldest epicurean magazine, she declined. Yet Reichl had been reading Gourmet since she was eight; it had inspired her career. How could she say no? It is the story of the moment restaurants became an important part of popular culture, a time when the rise of the farm-to-table movement changed, forever, the way we eat. Readers will meet legendary chefs like David Chang and Eric Ripert, idiosyncratic writers like David Foster Wallace, and a colorful group of editors and art directors who, under Reichl's leadership, transformed stately Gourmet into a cutting-edge publication. This was the golden age of print media--the last spendthrift gasp before the Internet turned the magazine world upside down. Complete with recipes, Save Me the Plums is a personal journey of a woman coming to terms with being in charge and making a mark, following a passion and holding on to her dreams--even when she ends up in a place she never expected to be.""(Description provided by publisher).How to AttendThis event takes place on Zoom.&nbsp;Register at least 24 hours before the event.&nbsp;You√ïll receive an email with a link to the secure Zoom meeting about 24 hours before the meeting.

113507,Food Memoir Book Discussion: Notes from a Young Black Chef,"Join a librarian from Legler Regional in a new book club featuring food memoirs! We will discuss&nbsp;Notes From A Young Black Chef&nbsp;by Kwame Onwuachi.""By the time he was twenty-seven years old, Kwame Onwuachi (winner of the 2019 James Beard Foundation Award for Rising Star Chef of the Year) had opened--and closed--one of the most talked about restaurants in America. He had launched his own catering company with twenty thousand dollars that he made from selling candy on the subway, yet he'd been told he would never make it on television because his cooking wasn't ""Southern"" enough. In this inspiring memoir about the intersection of race, fame, and food, he shares the remarkable story of his culinary coming-of-age.""

The reader is invited into a world of lost libraries and locked gardens, of marshlands where the drowned dead live and a city where all the clocks have stopped; students hone their skills at puppet schools, the Homely Wench Society commits a guerrilla book-swap, and lovers exchange books and roses on St. Jordi's Day.&nbsp; It is a collection of towering imagination, marked by baroque beauty and a deep sensuousness.&nbsp;How to attend:This event takes place on Zoom.

106840,Adult Book Discussion: Beneath a Scarlet Sky,"Join Albany Park Branch's book club as we discuss&nbsp;Beneath A Scarlet Sky&nbsp;by Mark T. Sullivan.&nbsp;&nbsp;""Edgar-finalist Sullivan (Triple Cross) lays on history with a trowel in this overstuffed tale of derring-do set in Italy during WWII. In 1943, 17-year-old Pino Lella's parents send him to the mountains to escape the bombardment of Milan. When he returns home on the eve of his 18th birthday, his parents urge him to join the German army to avoid the draft and thus be spared a one-way ticket to the Russian front. As the months go by, Pino turns up, Zelig-like, to witness every significant element of wartime life. He leads Jewish refugees across the dangerously snowy alps to the Swiss border, confronts local bandits masquerading as members of the anti-Fascist resistance, watches as people are loaded into boxcars destined for Auschwitz, overhears what could be the talk of the German generals' plot to overthrow Hitler, finds girls and wine for American army officers, and so on. Facing a few obstacles he can't overcome, the heroic Pino easily outfoxes the Nazis. Agent: Meg Ruley, Jane Rotrosen Agency. (May) ¬© Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

139605,"Massive Stars, Supernova Explosions, and the Fascinating Story of SN 1987A","Supernova explosions have fascinated mankind for millennia.  For the past 35 years, astronomers have been keenly following the results of the explosion of a star in a nearby galaxy - SN 1987A - the nearest supernova to us in over 300 years. Using spectacular pictures from space telescopes, computer animations and numerical simulations, this talk will discuss massive stars, supernova explosions, and the fascinating case of SN 1987A. Our speaker, Vikram Dwarkadas, is a Research Professor in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. He grew up in India, came to the US to attend graduate school, and has been here since, except for a small detour to Sydney, Australia.  His research interests include winds and mass loss from stars, supernova explosions and their aftermath, shock waves, X-ray and gamma-ray emission from supernovae and supernova remnants, interstellar phenomena, and the formation of the solar system. His work has received support from several granting agencies. He has presented numerous popular level talks and is highly involved in education and public outreach efforts.

135141,Voices for Justice: Author Julissa Arce,"Chicago Public Library is pleased to welcome Julissa Arce author of You Sound Like A White Girl: The Case for Rejecting Assimilation as part of our Voices for Justice series and in celebration of Latinx Heritage Month. Julissa Arce is a writer, activist, and social changemaker. She is the nationally best-selling author of My (Underground) American Dream and Someone Like Me. Her writing has appeared in the New York Times, TIME Magazine, CNN, CNBC, Vogue and other outlets. Her newest book, You Sound Like a White Girl: The Case for Rejecting Assimilation, is a powerful dual polemic and manifesto against the myth that assimilation leads to happiness and belonging for immigrants in America. Instead, she calls for a celebration of our uniqueness, our origins, our heritage, and the beauty of the differences that actually make us Americans. Prior to becoming an author and immigrant rights activist, Julissa built a successful career on Wall Street working for Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, and had seemingly achieved the American Dream√ëyet she was not part of what legally defined an American.Julissa immigrated to America from Mexico at the age of 11 and was undocumented for almost 15 years, some of them spent rising to prominence on Wall Street. In order to help other young people in similar circumstances, she co-founded the Ascend Educational Fund (AEF). AEF is a college scholarship and mentorship program for immigrant students in New York City, regardless of their ethnicity, national origin or immigration status.   Julissa was named one of People en Espa¬ñol√ïs 25 Most Powerful Women of 2017 and 2022, and 2018√ïs Woman of the Year by the City of Los Angeles. She is a leading voice in the fight for social justice, immigrant rights and education equality.Julissa serves on the board of directors of the National Immigration Law Center. She was officially sworn in as an American citizen in August of 2014 and currently lives in Los Angeles with her husband and their two cats, Nikko and Pancho. She will be in conversation with Kelly Garcia. Kelly Garcia is a bilingual staff writer for the Chicago Reader, the city's bi-weekly alternative newspaper, where she writes about politics, police, and intra community issues on the Southwest Side. She was previously a summer reporting resident for Injustice Watch and a Civic Reporting Fellow for City Bureau.

76409,Long Endurance Space Flight,"<p>As in-training members of NASA‚Äôs mission control staff, students will

explore the principles of scale, proportion, time and distance to gain an

understanding of the problems that could arise on a long endurance

space flight or when rovers need to communicate issues back to mission

control. To accomplish this, students will first engage in a series of

questions related to scale, proportion and quantity to activate prior

knowledge before watching a video that takes them on a journey from

the subatomic level to the edge of the universe. They will then explore

several maps as they discuss how the scales vary, which will lead them

to learn about the units of distance used by astronomers. Next, students

will research the ways long endurance space flights put stress on space

travelers‚Äô bodies and how these effects can be tempered and monitored.

In a final exploration of the effects of long-distance flights, students will

participate in a simulation of communication delays that occur during

such journeys and will evaluate other lessons that mission control staff

have learned in the past. Students will ultimately apply what they have

learned as they write a personal statement that outlines how they believe

NASA should approach these perilous but important voyages

145391,Voices for Justice: Saket Soni: The Great Escape,"Chicago Public Library is pleased to welcome Saket Soni to speak on his book The Great Escape: A True Story Of Forced Labor And Immigrant Dreams In America as part of our Voices&nbsp;For&nbsp;Justice speaker series.&nbsp;Organizer and author Saket Soni is recognized as a national expert on post-disaster economies, immigrant rights and the future of work. Originally from New Delhi, India, Saket began his career as a community organizer in Chicago at the Coalition of African, Asian, European, and Latino Immigrants of Illinois.&nbsp;After Hurricane Katrina, in 2006, Saket co-founded the New Orleans Workers' Center For Racial Justice. Under his leadership, the organization won organizing and policy victories for both U.S.-born and immigrant workers engaged in the reconstruction of New Orleans. In 2011, Saket founded the National Guestworker Alliance, an organization focused on defending the human rights and dignity of guestworkers in America.&nbsp;Saket co-authored And Injustice For All: Workers√ï Lives In the Reconstruction, the most comprehensive report on race in the reconstruction of the post-Katrina Gulf Coast, as well as Never Again: Lessons of the Gustav Evacuation, an account of the inequities in the response to Hurricane Gustav in 2009, which led to new state policies and new norms for evacuating the most vulnerable residents in preparation for disaster.&nbsp;&nbsp;His new book, The Great Escape: A True Story Of Forced Labor And Immigrant Dreams In America, is an&nbsp;eye-opening true story about immigrants in America, a visionary labor leader devises a plan that wins the citizenship of 500 workers from India after being exposed to inhumane conditions._In late 2006, Saket Soni, a 28-year-old, Indian-born community organizer received an anonymous phone call from an Indian migrant worker inside a Mississippi labor camp. He and 500 other men were living in squalor in Gulf Coast √íman camps,√ì surrounded by barbed wire, watched by armed guards, crammed into cold trailers with putrid portable toilets, forced to eat moldy bread and frozen rice. Worse, lured by the promise of good work and green cards, the men had desperately scraped together up to $20,000 each to apply for this √íopportunity√ì to rebuild oil rigs after Hurricane Katrina, putting their families into impossible debt. During a series of clandestine meetings, Soni and the workers devise a bold plan. In The Great Escape, Soni traces the workers√ï extraordinary escape, their march on foot to Washington DC, and their 23-day-hunger strike to bring attention to their cause. Along the way, ICE agents try to deport the men, company officials work to discredit them, and politicians avert their eyes. But none of this shakes the workers√ï determination to win their dignity and keep their promises to their families. Weaving a deeply personal journey with a riveting tale of 21st-century forced labor, Soni takes us into the hidden lives of the foreign workers the US increasingly relies on for cheap skilled labor to rebuild after climate disasters. The Great Escape is the astonishing story of one of the largest human trafficking cases in modern American history√ëand the workers√ï heroic journey for justice.How to AttendThis event takes place in person.

137241,Meet Author Fatimah Asghar in Conversation with Jamila Woods,"Join author Fatimah Asghar as she discusses her novel When We Were Sisters. Asghar will be in conversation with Jamila Woods. In this heartrending, lyrical debut work of fiction, Fatimah Asghar traces the intense bond of three orphaned siblings who, after their parents die, are left to raise one another. The youngest, Kausar, grapples with the incomprehensible loss of their parents as she also charts out her own understanding of gender; Aisha, the middle sister, spars with her √ícrybaby√ì younger sibling as she desperately tries to hold on to her sense of family in an impossible situation; and Noreen, the eldest, does her best in the role of sister-mother while also trying to create a life for herself, on her own terms.As Kausar grows up, she must contend with the collision of her private and public worlds, and choose whether to remain in the life of love, sorrow, and codependency that she√ïs known or carve out a new path for herself. When We Were Sisters tenderly examines the bonds and fractures of sisterhood, names the perils of being three Muslim American girls alone against the world, and ultimately illustrates how those who√ïve lost everything might still make homes in one another.Fatimah Asghar, author of If They Come for Us, is a poet, filmmaker, educator, and performer. She is the writer and co-creator of Brown Girls, an Emmy-nominated web series that highlights friendships between women of color. Along with Safia Elhillo, she is the editor of Halal If You Hear Me, an anthology that celebrates Muslim writers who are also women, queer, gender-nonconforming, and/or trans.Jamila Woods is a poet and singer songwriter born and raised in Chicago. Woods graduated from Brown University with a BA in Africana Studies and Theatre and Performance Studies. In 2012, she published her first chapbook, The Truth About Dolls, which includes a Pushcart Prize-nominated poem about Frida Kahlo. Her poetry has been featured in the anthologies The Uncommon Core: Contemporary Poems for Learning & Living (2013), Courage: Daring Poems for Gutsy Girls (2014), and The Breakbeat Poets: New American Poetry in the Age of Hip-Hop (2015). _As an acclaimed singer and songwriter, Woods released her debut album, HEAVN in 2016 and her second studio album, LEGACY!

She will speak about her new book, Once I Was You, where Hinojosa tells the story of immigration in America through her family√ïs experiences and decades of reporting, painting an unflinching portrait of a country in crisis. Maria will be in conversation with Chicago writer, actor, singer and producer Sandra Delgado.As a reporter who was the first Latina in many newsrooms, Maria Hinojosa dreamt of a space where she could create independent, multimedia journalism that explores and gives a critical voice to the diverse American experience. She made that dream a reality in 2010 when she created Futuro Media, an independent, nonprofit newsroom based in Harlem, NYC with the mission to create multimedia content from a POC perspective. Hinojasa√ïs Pulitzer Prize winning podcast, √íSuave√ì, focuses on her relationship with David Luis ""Suave"" Gonzalez, in addition to telling the story of thousands of other people sentenced to die in prison for a crime they committed as a minor.

Murrow Award from the Overseas Press Club, and the Ruben Salazar Lifetime Achievement Award from the NAHJ. She has been honored with her own day in October by New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio and has been recognized by People En Espa¬ñol as one of the 25 most powerful Latina women. Additionally, Hinojosa was the first Latina to anchor a PBS FRONTLINE report: √íLost in Detention√ì which aired in October 2011 and was the first to explore abuse at immigrant detention facilities, garnering attention from Capitol Hill as well as both the mainstream and Spanish-language media.Sandra Delgado is a Colombian-American writer, actor, singer and producer born and raised in Chicago. She writes plays inspired by underknown histories centering Latine lives. She is best known for her play with music, La Havana Madrid, which enjoyed sold-out runs at Steppenwolf and Goodman Theatre, and most recently in a co-production with Teatro Vista and Collaboraction.

This title is available in paperback and ebook formats.

One mother threatens to sing in public anytime her daughters argue; another allows her daughter to play with tampons to get a few minutes on the toilet alone. For parents and caregivers with kids of all ages, the unconventional √íwins√ì in this book have helped children to diversify their appetites, stop sibling rivalry, cultivate independence, develop manners, and open up√ëas well as parents themselves to find imaginative ways of salvaging time, money, intimacy, and their sanity.""This book club will meet the first Saturday morning each month.How to AttendThis event takes place in person.

Celebrate the small wins and find support for the struggles among parents and caregivers in the community.  Books will be available for participants at the Humboldt Park Branch circulation desk for one month prior to our meeting date.For August, we will discuss Cribsheet: a Data-driven Guide to Better, More Relaxed Parenting, From Birth to Preschool by Emily Oster.  This title is available in paperback, ebook, and downloadable audiobook formats.  From the publisher: ""From the author of Expecting Better... With Expecting Better, award-winning economist Emily Oster spotted a need in the pregnancy market for advice that gave women the information they needed to make the best decision for their own pregnancies. By digging into the data, Oster found that much of the conventional pregnancy wisdom was wrong. In Cribsheet, she now tackles an even great challenge: decision making in the early years of parenting. As any new parent knows, there is an abundance of often-conflicting advice hurled at you from doctors, family, friends, and the internet. From the earliest days, parents get the message that they must make certain choices around feeding, sleep, and schedule or all will be lost. There's a rule--or three--for everything. But the benefits of these choices can be overstated, and the tradeoffs can be profound. How do you make your own best decision? Armed with the data, Oster finds that the conventional wisdom doesn't always hold up. She debunks myths around breastfeeding (not a panacea), sleep training (not so bad!), potty training (wait until they're ready or possibly bribe with M&Ms), language acquisition (early talkers aren't necessarily geniuses), and many other topics. She also shows parents how to think through freighted questions like if and how to go back to work, how to think about toddler discipline, and how to have a relationship and parent at the same time. Economics is the science of decision-making, and CRIBSHEET is a thinking parent's guide to the chaos and frequent misinformation of the early years. Emily Oster is a trained expert--and mom of two--who can empower us to make better, less fraught decisions--and stay sane in the years before preschool.""This book club will meet the first Saturday morning each month.How to AttendThis event takes place in person.

138322,"Things Stolen, Things Returned: Two Films about the Kwakwakawakw Nation with Nalaga Donna Cranmer and Judy Hoffman","Join us for a screening of two films about the Kwakwaka'wakw Nation with 'Nalaga Donna Cranmer and Judy HoffmanBox of Treasures (Chuck Olin, 1983, 28 min.) documents the return of ritual objects taken by the Canadian government to the Kwakiut√ïl, a First Nations community in British Columbia. The √ípotlach√ì was their way of celebrating their culture, their identity, and their heritage. A ritual passing down of treasures, it symbolized a rebirth of tradition, a positive affirmation of their identity, past and present. In 1980, the U√ïmista Cultural Centre opened its doors to receive and house the cultural treasures that had been seized decades earlier. Our Voices, Our Stories (Barbara Cranmer, 2015, 39 min.) documents a gathering of residential school survivors for a ceremony marking the demolition of the St. Michael's Residential School. As part of the Canadian government√ïs attempt to eliminate what it considered the √íIndian problem,√ì tens of thousands of Indigenous children were taken from their families and sent to residential schools, which were designed to stamp out Indigenous lifeways. Between 1929 and 1975, almost 10,000 Indigenous children attended St. Michael√ïs. Scores of children died at the school, many were abused, and many never returned to their families. The film highlights the powerful accounts of survivors and their families.√îNalaga Donna Cranmer is from the √îNamgis band of the Kwakwaka√ïwakw Nation from Alert Bay, British Columbia. A master weaver, she has been weaving with cedar bark for over 25 years and Chilkat weave for 16 years. She has served as Principal of Wagalus Elementary School in Fort Rupert, and worked for 16 years as a Kwakwala language and culture teacher at T√ï_isalagilakw School in √îYalis (Alert Bay).Judy Hoffman has worked in film and video for over 35 years. Hoffman played a major role in the formation of Kartemquin Films. Her credits include numerous PBS series, including Daley: The Last Boss, for ""American Experience,"" and Ken Burns' Baseball, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Jazz. A major focus of her work has been with the Kwakwaka'wakw First Nation of British Columbia, producing films and videotapes about the reclaiming of Native culture. She was the Associate Producer on the award-winning Box of Treasures, and for over ten years Hoffman directed a video training program on the 'Namgis Reserve so that the Kwakwaka'wakw could make their own tapes, and she continues to work with them on their projects.South Side Projections presents films at locations across Chicago√ïs south side to foster conversation about complex social and political issues. At many screenings, we enlist scholars, activists, and filmmakers to lead discussions, while other screenings offer opportunities to present seldom-seen films of historical and artistic value to the communities of Chicago√ïs south side. In all cases we are a springboard to a deeper understanding of our communities and the broader world.How to Attend This event takes place in person.

146073,Adult Book Discussion: I'm Telling the Truth but I'm Lying,"Join Albany Park for&nbsp;a discussion of I'm Telling the Truth, but I'm Lying by Bassey Ikpi.From her early childhood in Nigeria through her adolescence in Oklahoma, Bassey Ikpi lived with a tumult of emotions, cycling between extreme euphoria and deep depression-sometimes within the course of a single day. By the time she was in her early twenties, Bassey was a spoken word artist and traveling with HBO's Def Poetry Jam, channeling her life into art. But beneath the facade of the confident performer, Bassey's mental health was in a precipitous decline, culminating in a breakdown that resulted in hospitalization and a diagnosis of Bipolar II. In I'm Telling the Truth, But I'm Lying, Bassey Ikpi breaks open our understanding of mental health by giving us intimate access to her own. Exploring shame, confusion, medication, and family in the process, Bassey looks at how mental health impacts every aspect of our lives-how we appear to others, and more importantly to ourselves-and challenges our preconception about what it means to be ""normal."" Viscerally raw and honest, the result is an exploration of the stories we tell ourselves to make sense of who we are-and the ways, as honest as we try to be, each of these stories can also be a lie.&nbsp;A limited number of copies are available at the branch.How to AttendThis event takes place in person.

138466,Film Screening: Smoke Signals (1998),"Join us for a screening of the film Smoke Signals.A Native American (Adam Beach) deals with the death of his estranged father. Evan Adams, Irene Bedard, Gary Farmer.This dramatic feature was written, directed, and co-produced by Native Americans. Native American writer Sherman Alexie scripted this adaptation of his 1993 short story collection The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven. Director Chris Eyre's previous short Someone Kept Saying Powwow is incorporated into the 88-minute feature. Developed at the Sundance Lab in 1995, the film was a winner of both the Audience Award and the Filmmakers' Trophy at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival. In 1976, an infant survives a fire that kills his parents. In a flash forward to the present day, the infant has grown up to become the skinny, nerdy adult Thomas (Evan Adams). At Idaho's desolate Coeur d'Alene Indian reservation, the overeager youth is mostly ignored by others, including stoic athletic Victor Joseph (Adam Beach), even though it was Victor's father, alcoholic Arnold Joseph (Gary Farmer), who saved the infant Thomas' life in the fire. A drunken Arnold later abandoned his family, and Victor hasn't seen his father in a decade. When Victor learns of Arnold's death in Phoenix, Thomas offers to pay for the trip to Phoenix if he can accompany Victor. They make an odd couple since Victor is embarrassed by Thomas' geekiness. In Phoenix, they find that Arnold lived in a small trailer in the desert, and they meet Arnold's friend Suzy Song (Irene Bedard), who provides disturbing truths about Arnold that impact on Victor. ~ Bhob Stewart, Rovi¬© Miramax Films - 88 minutes - Rated PG-13How to AttendThis event takes place in person.

Just a quick mouth swab and soon you'll be matched with your perfect partner--the one you're genetically made for. That's the promise made by Match Your DNA. A decade ago, the company announced that they had found the gene that pairs each of us with our soul mate. Since then, millions of people around the world have been matched. But the discovery has its downsides: test results have led to the breakup of countless relationships and upended the traditional ideas of dating, romance and love. Now five very different people have received the notification that they've been ""Matched."" They're each about to meet their one true love. But ""happily ever after"" isn't guaranteed for everyone. Because even soul mates have secrets. And some are more shocking than others...

139795,Adult Book Discussion: Memorial Drive,"Join Jenny at the North Pulaski Branch for a discussion of Memorial Drive. ""Exploring personal trauma, memory, and closure, Poet Laureate and Pulitzer Prize-winner Trethewey returns to the site of her mother's murder. The daughter of an African American mother and white Canadian father, Trethewey grew up in civil rights-era Mississippi and Georgia. After her parents' divorce, her mother married an unstable Vietnam veteran who, over time, became psychologically and physically abusive. After ten years, her mother left with Tretheway and her younger brother in tow but continued to live in fear of her ex-husband. Working with victims' rights groups, the state's attorney general, and local police, her mother achieved renewed independence and strength. But that did not stop Tretheway's former stepfather from murdering her mother in June 1985. Through spare prose and vivid imagery, the author presents a narrative of a trauma survivor's need to remember a past that, for 30 years, lapsed into the mind's shadows. VERDICT A moving, heartbreaking memoir about a traumatic event and the path to healing. --Leah Huey"" Dekalb Public LibraryCopies are available at the Circulation desk.

127713,"2022 American Experience Book Club: Endurance: a Year in Space, a Lifetime of Discovery","The 2022 American Experience Book Club explores ideas, movements and people featured on the PBS series American Experience. This year's selection is&nbsp;Endurance by Scott Kelly.""The veteran of four space flights and the American record holder for consecutive days spent in space, Scott Kelly has experienced things very few have. Now, he takes us inside a sphere utterly hostile to human life. He describes navigating the extreme challenges of long-term spaceflight√ëthe devastating effects on the body, the isolation from everyone he loves and the comforts of Earth, the pressures of constant close cohabitation, and the catastrophic risks of depressurization or colliding with space junk. But perhaps the most haunting challenge is that of being unable to help should tragedy strike at home, something Kelly knows about firsthand.&nbsp;Kelly's humanity, compassion, humor, and passion resonate throughout, as he recalls his rough-and-tumble New Jersey childhood and the youthful inspiration that sparked his astounding career. Here, in his personal story, we see the triumph of the human imagination, the strength of the human will, and the infinite wonder of the galaxy."" Backcover&nbsp;√íChasing the Moon,√ì a film by Robert Stone, reimagines the race to the moon for a new generation, upending much of the conventional mythology surrounding the effort. The series recasts the Space Age as a fascinating stew of scientific innovation, political calculation, media spectacle, visionary impulses and personal drama. Utilizing a visual feast of previously overlooked and lost archival material √ë much of which has never before been seen by the public √ë the film features a diverse cast of characters who played key roles in these historic events. Among those included are astronauts Buzz Aldrin, Frank Borman and Bill Anders; Sergei Khrushchev, son of the former Soviet premier and a leading Soviet rocket engineer; Poppy Northcutt, a 25-year old √ímathematics whiz√ì who gained worldwide attention as the first woman to serve in the all-male bastion of NASA√ïs Mission Control; and Ed Dwight, the Air Force pilot selected by the Kennedy administration to train as America√ïs first black astronaut.""&nbsp;-&nbsp;American Experience √ê PBS&nbsp;Documentary Release Date: July, 2019How to AttendThis event takes place in person.

Killers of the Flower Moon is available for adults (2018) and as an adapted young readers edition (2021).√íIn the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.Then, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. One of her relatives was shot. Another was poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more and more Osage were dying under mysterious circumstances, and many of those who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered.As the death toll rose, the newly created FBI took up the case, and the young director, J. Edgar Hoover, turned to a former Texas Ranger named Tom White to try to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including a Native American agent who infiltrated the region, and together with the Osage began to expose one of the most chilling conspiracies in American history.√ì (Publisher Vintage Books)Registration is recommended but not required.
