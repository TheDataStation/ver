Re: Freedom of Information Act Request

To Whom It May Concern:

Pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), as amended (5 ILCS 140/1 et seq.), I, the undersigned, am requesting the following public records from the Chicago Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection:

1. A list of all private booting licenses granted in Chicago.

2. A list of all registered locations at which the aforementioned licensees engage in booting operations.

3. Any and all communications between BACP Commissioner Kenneth Meyer and lobbyist Joseph Moore and/or his firm Joe Moore Strategies from December 2021 to the present, including emails and text messages.

I will remind you that rulings in multiple court cases have found that communications pertaining to public business conducted on a private device (i.e. texts on a personal cell phone) are still subject to public records laws.

This information will be used for newsgathering and is not for a commercial purpose. I would appreciate receiving all documentation electronically.

I look forward to hearing from you in writing within five working days, as required by 5 ILCS 140/3.

Randal B. Curtis,,"I care to submit an official complaint once again. I have been given several departments and contact information since the initial incidence. I'm not sure which office or department is the correct place to file my complaint. Please file, direct or forward this complaint to the proper authorities overseeing these type of matters. 
The following is: The basis of my complaint and contact information.
On July 14 approximately 1:45 am at ORD (O'Hare Airport) I was approached by an American United Cab for service. I stated to the driver that I was bound for Rivers casino down the road. This was his second attempt around to solicit my trip. I informed the person working at the ORD taxi stand, who warned him the first time when he drove off. After a short period of time and no other cabs arriving for a pickup, I accepted the only cab 3899 services.
Upon arriving at the River, I handed the driver a 100 dollar bill, whereas the driver took my money and gave me $50 worth of change back. I asked to see his meter for fares, which he had completely powered off, so I request a receipt, which he could not and did not have and did not produce. I then asked him his name, which I could not understand and may have been Farnado. I wrote down the number on his cab 3899.
I contacted the American United cab company thereafter. I was given another number to contact, which I attempted to reach that number also to file an official complaint. I left a message and couple days later, I received a returned call and initiated my first complaint. I was subsequently informed his name is Muneer, and he had several other complaints accredited to his services sanctions and infractions levied against this driver, and he was currently on suspension at that very moment, and they took my information, and said they would send me a $10 check. I now have that check as evidence to this incidence and to substantiate my claim and complaint. This negligence of this company to leave such a predator in their employment is a subject to be addressed later.
I am interested in filing a FOIA for the information surrounding this involved employee, and would appreciate all relevant and pertinent background information or in the interim being directed to the right department for caring out the FOIA request if this department does not handle such matters.

For the following reasons as explained to 311 several times :

7/1/22 asked how 311 handles cable complaints; informed asks cable company if any issues-cases usually closed- 311 informed mailing complaint form so complete -mail so has additional info for investigation (learned employee just did complaint herself-SR 22-01138580). 7/11/22 called explained what occurred-switched to supervisor-said doing complaint form so have some info for investigation (SR 22-01208285). Same day did online complaint (SR 22-01208990) and upload questions so for investigation at least know what to ask cable company-as cable company setup and/or wiring or equipment has resulted in not just their equipment damaged yet 37” TV in addition to network breached resulting in individuals attempting to breach bank accounts several times. Today, 8/8/22 left message with Maria Rodriguez (Business Affairs/Cable Division) again as have key info if city really does investigate as would like issues with cable company resolved as this has been occurring now for 4 years unabated. Would like the City of Chicago which is responsible for regulating cable providers here and not just allowing them to do whatever they want as paying for this service- to at least attempt to ask cable company the questions posed as this would aid in why since 2019 unit owner has had problems that continue unresolved and unaddressed by cable company. -Greg Jones, MSW for unit owner Rosia Hill.",2022-08-09T00:00:00.000,2022-08-16T00:00:00.000

increased involvement of school counselors in discipline policies and procedures, (v) focused work on improving/protecting school climate through restorative strategies programs and other effective school discipline following the enactment of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act;xxii [64] your discussions about March for Our Lives as a “youth-led movement dedicated to promoting civic engagement, education, and direct action by youth to eliminate the epidemic of gun violence;” [65] your discussions about March for Our Lives as a

This morning I received a call and voicemail on  3/8/22 at 11:18am  Central Standard Time. The voicemail stated that I needed to call back or upload 2 additional rent receipts and a copy of my lease agreement that includes my name because it was cut off in the original upload. The voicemail stated to have these documents uploaded by the end of the day. I uploaded documents and called back on 3/8/22 at 12:07pm Central Standard Time. I was told my application was rejected and I needed to speak with a supervisor. 

Prior to today I have never received a call or voicemail indicating I needed any additional information. The discrepancy is because the voicemail details the information I needed to submit by the end of the day or my application is subject to rejection but when following the instructions the application was rejected anyway.

Dora Jung,Belgrade Dance Festival,"I am writing to you in the name of the Belgrade Dance Festival.
Thanks to this festival, Belgrade has become an important stop over in biographies of the artists who create trends in the area of artistic dance and theatre, a place where new productions are discovered and where young and renowned authors are presented with equal attention. Ongoing trends of the programme have determined the position of this event on the global map, while high standards and brave introduction of new choreographic
manuscripts and esthetics are improving expectations of the audience and are dictating challenges of content creation.

The Belgrade Dance Festival has represented works from the Hubbard Street Dance of Chicago, and has introduced to the Belgrade audience this great company. And a letter of thanks was sent from the former Mayor of Chicago, Mr. Emanuel, for this matter.

As the Belgrade Dance Festival  approaches it's jubilee, (2023), when the Festival will mark two decades of its duration, we plan to release a new monograph and prepare a documentary film.
In that matter, I am writing you a letter, in hope of your assistance and help with an enormously bad experience we had in the past two days with a tech company based in Chicago.

The Belgrade Dance Festival bought a camera through the invoice provided to us by the Personal Electronics shop in Chicago on 02/18.2022. https://personalelectronicsltd.com/
We have emails where they have confirmed that they have received the payment of 5000$. on 2/23/2022. to an account in your bank, account number: [REDACTED], account holder name Jose R Alejo, IBAN: [REDACTED], SWIFT code: [REDACTED]

We have also paid for the shipping which was part of the invoice. 
Through whatsapp they have asked for an additional 999$ for the shipment to be made, and they did not want to send this requirement through an official email. Thus, we have asked for a refund of our money, because mentioning or trying to add any additional costs in this phase, through whatsapp messages, is not acceptable. They have issued one and final invoice, according to which we performed the payment. 
Today, 02/24/2022. They have said that if we don't pay 999$ they will neither refund us the $5000 nor will they send the camera to the address of our partner organization in New York, the Joyce Theater. 
The invoice was named on Personal Electronics Limited, while the payment and bank instructions were directed to an individual : Jose Alejo,
this is a clear indication of money laundering. We are reporting to you fraudulent activity and mishandling and fooling consumers.

I am sending you attached the invoice to which we have made the payment, the SWIFT which confirms that the money has been transferred, and part from the email communication.
The Belgrade Dance Festival is a governmental organization and the US Embassy in Serbia has been informed about this case. We also informed the Serbian Embassy in Washington and the Serbian Consulate in Chicago.",2022-02-25T00:00:00.000,2022-03-04T00:00:00.000

Any and all written correspondence and documents between BACP/LLCC and Package Goods Applicant Garfields Beverage Warehouse OT LLC, or applicant's representative, regarding Application Number 637349 - Account Number 480666, including but not limited to any Plan of Operation, actions taken on any Plan of Operation, and actions taken on subject application.
***
Per your direction, I am submitting a revised written request to supplement my original 01/31/2022 request (Ref. K015707-013122) 22-FR-068 and to reply to your requests for clarification.

First and foremost, please be aware that the original request had a limited timeframe (date range) for requested documents; expressly “December 23, 2021 to and including the presentment date of FOIA Request” (01/31/2022).

Second, the Plan of Operation documents sought was limited to only the Plan or Plans submitted by Package Goods Applicant Garfields Beverage Warehouse OT LLC, Account Number 480666, to the Local Liquor Control Commission and/or Commissioner Trotter in Application Number 637349. The original request stated, “regarding Application Number 637349 – Account Number 480666, including but not limited to any Plan of Operation… on subject application.”

The Plan or Plans of Applicant submitted to Commissioner Trotter for consideration are not known to have been approved, therefore your production of all published Plans of Operation is not responsive to the narrow request for only those Plans submitted by Applicant Garfields in its Application numbered 637349. 

Third, written documents, both paper-based and electronic, of the actions taken on Application Number 637349 by the Local Liquor Control Commission and/or Commissioner Trotter on Applicant’s submitted Plan of Operation, and on Applicant’s application from December 23, 2021 to January 31, 2022 were requested.

Should the above be deemed insufficient to clarify the narrowness of the original request and fail to remove the broadness and burdensomeness interpreted into the original request, please narrow my request to:

Copy of Plan of Operation submitted by Package Goods Applicant Garfields Beverage Warehouse OT LLC, Account Number 480666, Application Number 637349, to Local Liquor Control Commission and Commissioner Trotter, on and after December 23, 2021 to present; Response(s) by Local Liquor Control Commission and Commissioner Trotter to said submitted Plan of Operation, on and after December 23, 2021 to present; and Final Denial or Approval decision by Local Liquor Control Commissioner Trotter to said Applicant’s Application, on and after December 23, 2021 to present, maintained in Account Number 480666, Application Number 637349 file.",2022-01-31T00:00:00.000,2022-02-07T00:00:00.000

Anubhav Chowdhury,University of Cambridge,"I am hoping to gain access to a version of the Chicago Taxi Trips Kaggle dataset which would allow me to identify which trips were completed by a given driver. I wish to use this dataset to produce my Master's thesis for my MPhil in Economic Research at the University of Cambridge, for a project analysing the labour supply choices of taxi drivers. This is an area of substantial interest in economics, pioneered by Nobel laureate Richard Thaler with Camerer et al (1997). This project's results could be useful to the City in its capacity as a public vehicle regulatory agency, and thus carry a public benefit. This project would require that the column in the Kaggle dataset representing ""taxi_id"" would instead have a unique identifier for a driver, rather than a medallion. I would only need to know which trips were completed by a given driver. Thus, these data could be pseudonymized before they are released to me to mitigate any privacy concerns.",2022-01-25T00:00:00.000,2022-02-01T00:00:00.000
