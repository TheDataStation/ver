    This meta-hash performs permutations on binary bucket keys
    and keeps a dictionary for this mapping.

    You use this just like every other LSHash implementation and
    add the actual binary hashes you want to use via the add_child_hash
    method. Each child hash will be used separatly.

    So to use this you have to do the following steps:

    1. Create HashPermutationMapper instance and use it in the Engine constructor
    2. Add your binary hashes as child hashes by calling add_child_hash()
    3. Store your vectors using the Engine
    4. Now when you query the bucket key map is used
