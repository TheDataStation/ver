# Contributing

Bugs and feature requests should be reported in the [GitHub issue
tracker](https://github.com/mitdbg/aurum-datadiscovery/issues/new) and
answer the following questions:

 - Motivation: Why should this be addressed? What is the purpose?
 - Input: What are the pre-conditions?
 - Output: What is the expected outcome after the issue has been addressed?
 - Test: How can the results listed in the "Output" be QA'ed?

For code contributions, these are the suggested steps:

 - Identify the change you'd like to make, e.g. fix a bug or add a feature.
   Larger contributions should always begin with [first creating an
   issue](https://github.com/mitdbg/aurum-datadiscovery/issues/new) to ensure
   that the change is properly scoped.
 - Fork the repository on GitHub.
 - Develop your change on a feature branch, which will typically be created from
the master branch, unless you know exactly what you are doing :)
 - Write tests to validate your change works as expected.
 - Create a pull request.
 - Address any issues raised during the code review.
 - Once you get a "+1" on the pull request, the change can be merged.

*This contributing.md is based on that one from mediative/eigenflow, thanks!*
